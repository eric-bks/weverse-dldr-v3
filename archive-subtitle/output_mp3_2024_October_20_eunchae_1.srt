00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:27,279
Hi

2
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,493
Wait a minute.
I was looking at the filter.

3
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,073
It's already on.

4
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:39,303
Is this better?

5
00:00:46,124 --> 00:00:47,801
Hello.

6
00:00:51,381 --> 00:00:52,468
I just...

7
00:00:53,298 --> 00:00:56,999
I just got off in Korea.

8
00:00:58,593 --> 00:01:00,233
So...

9
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:02,525
I'm waiting for my suitcase.

10
00:01:03,922 --> 00:01:05,773
So...

11
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,869
I came to play for a moment,
everyone.

12
00:01:09,254 --> 00:01:10,300
For a moment.

13
00:01:15,947 --> 00:01:17,817
I went to Japan.

14
00:01:17,885 --> 00:01:20,340
It's not an airport. It's my room.

15
00:01:24,013 --> 00:01:26,225
Last time, I was going to bed,

16
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,173
I was lying on my bed.

17
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:32,666
I only did voice live.

18
00:01:33,668 --> 00:01:36,607
At that time,
Fearnot always asked me to show my face.

19
00:01:36,675 --> 00:01:37,580
Today,

20
00:01:37,647 --> 00:01:39,327
It's not before I go to bed.

21
00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:42,090
My face is ready.

22
00:01:42,158 --> 00:01:43,164
I turned it on.

23
00:01:46,622 --> 00:01:48,628
It got pretty cold in Korea.

24
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:51,097
To say that,

25
00:01:52,473 --> 00:01:55,065
I've only been in Japan for a day.

26
00:02:03,877 --> 00:02:05,859
Fim's Club. I saw it.

27
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:08,029
Why am I the smallest?

28
00:02:08,096 --> 00:02:09,442
I don't know either.

29
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,693
Why?

30
00:02:13,036 --> 00:02:13,929
I was the smallest.

31
00:02:13,997 --> 00:02:15,115
Right?

32
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:20,300
I was the smallest.

33
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:23,201
Was Chaewon the biggest?

34
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,689
I saw it too.

35
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:39,212
Today, I was on the plane.
I usually sleep on the plane.

36
00:02:40,173 --> 00:02:42,672
But today, I didn't sleep

37
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:46,114
and watched the best baseball game.
It's my first time watching a game.

38
00:02:50,247 --> 00:02:52,761
Almost all of them are
watching the game together.

39
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:55,400
I was watching the best
baseball game alone.

40
00:02:55,647 --> 00:02:58,648
My heart was beating so fast.

41
00:02:58,793 --> 00:03:02,383
I watched the best
baseball game alone like this.

42
00:03:03,974 --> 00:03:05,864
I was watching the
best baseball game.

43
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:07,968
I finished it and got off the plane.

44
00:03:08,926 --> 00:03:11,859
Did you really succeed in ticketing?

45
00:03:12,853 --> 00:03:16,168
It's in the script.

46
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:25,593
When is the last time
you learned Japanese?

47
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:28,695
When was the last time
you learned Japanese?

48
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,377
Today...

49
00:03:31,206 --> 00:03:32,544
I remember.

50
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:34,367
Do you remember?

51
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:38,323
When?

52
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:40,702
When?

53
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:49,309
My hair is short.

54
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:56,233
My eyes look tired?

55
00:03:56,686 --> 00:03:58,372
Why? Do my eyes look tired?

56
00:04:00,068 --> 00:04:01,028
Really?

57
00:04:09,485 --> 00:04:10,393
I remember.

58
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,293
Today...

59
00:04:12,255 --> 00:04:13,628
I remember today.

60
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:16,503
Where is it?

61
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,700
This is my room.

62
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,300
Welcome to my room.

63
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:24,366
This is my bed.

64
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:27,317
Do you want me to show you?

65
00:04:28,866 --> 00:04:29,866
Ta-da.

66
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:35,399
Do you know this?

67
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:43,459
It's not the lion doll from
our first documentary.

68
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:47,653
It's a lion doll with a hood.

69
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,866
It's cute. I pulled it like
this and my eyebrows split.

70
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:57,806
I still have my eyes on
it and I still wear it a lot.

71
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,600
Yeah, I'm busy and going out.

72
00:05:18,214 --> 00:05:20,333
Is there something you're curious about?
My room?

73
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:24,577
I don't have much in my room.
My bed,

74
00:05:25,907 --> 00:05:28,791
my standby thingy from the Leniverse,

75
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,719
TV, TV, and

76
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:45,351
I'm sorry, but I'm not ready yet.

77
00:05:50,353 --> 00:05:52,059
"Show me anything."

78
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,999
There's a computer
right next to my bed.

79
00:06:07,151 --> 00:06:10,397
When I was really
crazy about Overwatch,

80
00:06:10,464 --> 00:06:14,287
I didn't want to live
without this computer.

81
00:06:15,131 --> 00:06:17,897
I didn't want to live
without this computer.

82
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,066
I don't play games now,

83
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,920
so I just use it as a desk.

84
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,758
Did you cut your hair today?

85
00:06:34,072 --> 00:06:35,740
I'm sorry, I just untied it.

86
00:06:39,712 --> 00:06:41,645
Please speak Japanese.

87
00:06:41,853 --> 00:06:43,521
Today...

88
00:06:43,589 --> 00:06:44,999
Today,

89
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,373
Today,

90
00:06:52,503 --> 00:06:54,727
To all the Fearnot,

91
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,441
I would like to thank everyone for coming
to the fan signing and press conference.

92
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:04,043
I'll always be enjoying
watching your moves.

93
00:07:05,053 --> 00:07:08,133
I'll always be enjoying
watching your moves.

94
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:35,048
Today's TMI: I cut my bangs
today because it was a little long.

95
00:07:36,846 --> 00:07:38,018
It's a little long.

96
00:07:39,872 --> 00:07:41,037
Perfect!

97
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,120
"Are you good at Japanese?"

98
00:07:43,424 --> 00:07:44,625
Me?

99
00:07:44,692 --> 00:07:47,133
Are you good at Japanese?

100
00:07:49,418 --> 00:07:50,385
Not yet.

101
00:07:50,452 --> 00:07:52,750
Apartment.

102
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:04,502
It's a perfect night.

103
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:06,175
Thank you. Perfect night.

104
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:08,638
Perfect night.

105
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:10,478
It's the best.

106
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:28,070
"I'm going to take an
English exam tomorrow."

107
00:08:28,137 --> 00:08:29,104
Fighting.

108
00:08:30,353 --> 00:08:31,466
Fighting!

109
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,908
Make me super crazy

110
00:09:05,218 --> 00:09:06,474
"Do a capture time"

111
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:07,841
Capture time?

112
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:11,181
Okay, since I turned on the camera,
let's capture time

113
00:09:11,368 --> 00:09:13,355
How should I do it? Capture time

114
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,160
Please read the
comments after the wink.

115
00:09:27,246 --> 00:09:31,539
I think my wink skills
have decreased.

116
00:09:33,858 --> 00:09:35,639
Why is this eye so closed?

117
00:09:38,594 --> 00:09:40,701
I can do it,
but I can't do it pretty.

118
00:09:41,407 --> 00:09:43,050
I can't do a pretty wink.

119
00:09:49,944 --> 00:09:51,003
I don't like it.

120
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,327
"V, please." V.

121
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,181
V.

122
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,471
Next.

123
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:12,224
Hurry up.

124
00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:14,133
Capture time.

125
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,296
Quack's face.

126
00:10:20,326 --> 00:10:21,218
Wait a minute.

127
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,033
Next.

128
00:10:29,773 --> 00:10:31,199
Cat heart.

129
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,632
Ta-da.

130
00:10:42,038 --> 00:10:43,451
Cat ears.

131
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:51,639
End.

132
00:10:54,414 --> 00:10:55,468
End.

133
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,833
Guys, really.
I just wanted to say good night.

134
00:10:59,846 --> 00:11:01,895
I just wanted to say good night.

135
00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:04,838
Good night, everyone.

136
00:11:05,405 --> 00:11:06,668
I'm ready someday.

137
00:11:06,915 --> 00:11:07,922
I'll be ready someday.

138
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,771
If you're ready,
I'll introduce you to the room.

139
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:17,348
Bye.

140
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:19,433
Good night.

141
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,339
Thank you.

142
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,819
I love you.

143
00:11:23,012 --> 00:11:23,887
Thank you.

144
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,219
Don't catch a cold.

145
00:11:28,286 --> 00:11:29,133
Bye, everyone.

146
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,133
Good night.

147
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,133
Bye.
