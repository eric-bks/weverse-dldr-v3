1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,623
(O.O)

2
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:18,764
Fearnot!

3
00:00:21,725 --> 00:00:22,963
It's not a rehearsal, right?

4
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:24,564
Oh, here it is!

5
00:00:26,504 --> 00:00:27,404
Hi

6
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:30,358
Hello

7
00:00:36,686 --> 00:00:37,839
Hello

8
00:00:39,888 --> 00:00:41,850
Everyone gather, gather, gather

9
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:53,792
You didn't expect it, right?

10
00:00:54,753 --> 00:00:56,754
I didn't expect it either

11
00:01:00,296 --> 00:01:01,732
We just came back from

12
00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:03,412
doing the choreography

13
00:01:04,976 --> 00:01:06,047
Right now

14
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,025
So my hair is a little bit like that

15
00:01:16,635 --> 00:01:17,975
All of a sudden?

16
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:21,956
All of a sudden, it's okay

17
00:01:24,286 --> 00:01:26,439
We'll do the choreography tomorrow

18
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:29,843
Golden Wave

19
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:32,291
the day after tomorrow.

20
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:34,730
Right, right I practiced

21
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:38,214
Fearnot, what are you doing?

22
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:41,324
It's Friday afternoon

23
00:01:47,615 --> 00:01:49,135
Hello

24
00:01:51,585 --> 00:01:52,439
Hi

25
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:02,331
"I'm going home."

26
00:02:02,824 --> 00:02:04,405
Thank you for your hard work

27
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:08,439
Wait a minute

28
00:02:12,261 --> 00:02:14,891
I wanted to play with Fearnot

29
00:02:15,376 --> 00:02:18,591
since I haven't played it in a while.
What's it?

30
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,114
"How are you?" I'm good.
How are you? Fearnot.

31
00:02:29,822 --> 00:02:30,823
Hi.

32
00:02:31,336 --> 00:02:32,800
Are you all busy right now?

33
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:38,617
There must be a lot of people
who are going home after work.

34
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:41,946
Or are you still working?

35
00:02:43,418 --> 00:02:44,359
Every day.

36
00:02:47,173 --> 00:02:51,137
Just living is amazing.

37
00:02:51,941 --> 00:02:52,942
We...

38
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:04,979
"I'm studying, but I came to see you."

39
00:03:05,046 --> 00:03:06,545
"I came to see you."

40
00:03:06,613 --> 00:03:07,713
No.

41
00:03:08,414 --> 00:03:10,374
Go study!

42
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,188
Oh, right.

43
00:03:14,857 --> 00:03:18,395
I'm going back to Osaka next month.

44
00:03:21,788 --> 00:03:24,140
It's getting a little cold in Japan.

45
00:03:25,404 --> 00:03:30,407
It's been a little cold in Korea lately.

46
00:03:36,777 --> 00:03:41,302
Zuha, These are my bangs.

47
00:03:45,297 --> 00:03:47,105
I have bangs here.

48
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,746
Welcome

49
00:04:02,963 --> 00:04:04,756
"Bangs or no bangs?"

50
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:09,651
No bangs.

51
00:04:13,164 --> 00:04:14,312
Vacation?

52
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,325
Oh yeah, I...

53
00:04:17,393 --> 00:04:19,320
I went to Paris with my mom.

54
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:26,519
I really wanted to go,

55
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:35,143
Originally, I wanted to go to
Italy or somewhere like that.

56
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:45,661
I wanted to go to a country
that I've never been to before.

57
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,982
I thought about it.

58
00:04:49,408 --> 00:04:56,425
I wanted to go to Paris
for my first vacation.

59
00:05:00,582 --> 00:05:01,795
Croissant Kkurasan

60
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,663
When I was studying abroad,

61
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:20,212
What was it?

62
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:23,212
Before the quarantine started,

63
00:05:24,174 --> 00:05:26,937
I had a vacation at a ballet school.

64
00:05:27,005 --> 00:05:28,475
So at that time,

65
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:34,245
My mom and dad came to the Netherlands.

66
00:05:35,092 --> 00:05:38,160
So I was there for about a week.

67
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:40,688
I took a train with my parents there.

68
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:44,965
It was my first trip to Paris.

69
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,681
I have a really good memory of that time.

70
00:05:48,952 --> 00:05:50,739
I wanted to go again.

71
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,332
So this time,

72
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,073
On the last day,

73
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:57,359
For lunch,

74
00:05:58,481 --> 00:05:59,676
I had to eat.

75
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:00,717
At that time,

76
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:03,494
Two years?

77
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:04,483
Three years?

78
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:09,613
I went with my mom and dad.

79
00:06:11,786 --> 00:06:13,787
What was it?

80
00:06:20,772 --> 00:06:21,778
What was the name?

81
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:26,183
Cascade?

82
00:06:27,241 --> 00:06:28,408
It's a type of food.

83
00:06:28,695 --> 00:06:30,047
In the name of that,

84
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:34,359
That kind of food.

85
00:06:38,584 --> 00:06:39,517
I went there.

86
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:41,657
I went again.

87
00:06:43,714 --> 00:06:45,844
I don't know what I'm saying.

88
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:47,327
Well, so,

89
00:06:47,394 --> 00:06:50,258
It's been 3 years since went to Paris.

90
00:06:50,462 --> 00:06:52,452
As a foreign student,

91
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,745
with my parents,

92
00:06:54,465 --> 00:06:59,149
We had dinner together.

93
00:06:59,236 --> 00:07:00,898
But this time,

94
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:03,896
the situation was changed completely.

95
00:07:04,138 --> 00:07:08,617
I'm eating the same food at the
same restaurant with my mom.

96
00:07:08,869 --> 00:07:10,971
I felt very strange.

97
00:07:11,596 --> 00:07:17,359
I think it's a very
meaningful restaurant for me.

98
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,538
It's moving.

99
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,605
Zuha, when is Leniverse coming out?

100
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:24,168
Leniverse?

101
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,108
Leniverse is...

102
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,359
You can look forward to it.

103
00:07:31,658 --> 00:07:33,130
Please look forward to it.

104
00:07:33,198 --> 00:07:38,138
Leniverse is really, really amazing.

105
00:07:39,296 --> 00:07:40,597
Really, really.

106
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:44,302
I think Leniverse knows
loyalty more than loyalty.

107
00:07:45,361 --> 00:07:46,294
Thank you so much.

108
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:47,674
Thank you and I love you.

109
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:53,341
There will be a lot of fun contents.

110
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,820
It's always been like that.

111
00:07:58,275 --> 00:07:59,576
It's always been like that.

112
00:08:00,371 --> 00:08:01,708
More...

113
00:08:01,776 --> 00:08:05,436
I think we'll be able to see a new
side of us

114
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,057
in a more diverse way.

115
00:08:09,796 --> 00:08:10,930
Today's fashion?

116
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:14,497
Today's fashion is totally comfort.

117
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,660
The theme is comfort.

118
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,395
"The shoe thief."

119
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,181
Right. That...

120
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:32,990
I was surprised when it suddenly came out.

121
00:08:35,654 --> 00:08:37,567
It came out suddenly.

122
00:08:38,464 --> 00:08:40,651
So, I was surprised, too.

123
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,522
But it turned out well.

124
00:08:43,852 --> 00:08:47,179
I took it like this with the flip-flops.

125
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,737
It turned out well when I took it upright.

126
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,111
It's so funny.

127
00:08:55,446 --> 00:08:57,788
I didn't even imagine it.

128
00:08:58,194 --> 00:09:02,476
I didn't know the
shoe thief would take it.

129
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,831
I really became a thief.

130
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:07,173
Chaewon.

131
00:09:19,063 --> 00:09:21,550
The other members are on

132
00:09:21,948 --> 00:09:23,441
their separate schedules.

133
00:09:25,343 --> 00:09:27,219
We've been together until now.

134
00:09:31,074 --> 00:09:32,833
"Spoiler?" What spoiler?

135
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:35,506
Fearnot really likes spoilers.

136
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,773
What kind of spoiler?

137
00:09:41,595 --> 00:09:43,159
The lighting is...

138
00:09:45,345 --> 00:09:46,297
It's working

139
00:09:55,984 --> 00:09:58,192
Another episode.

140
00:09:58,267 --> 00:10:02,677
We took a TikTok together

141
00:10:04,482 --> 00:10:06,532
Please wait for a moment

142
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,246
"Is the monitor the lighting?"

143
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:15,357
Yes, it is

144
00:10:15,424 --> 00:10:16,579
The monitor...

145
00:10:16,646 --> 00:10:18,233
My PC

146
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,429
The white background is my lighting

147
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,364
It's a white background.

148
00:10:25,432 --> 00:10:26,659
Like this

149
00:10:28,099 --> 00:10:29,033
The blue background...

150
00:10:29,101 --> 00:10:30,395
The blue background is fine.

151
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:31,961
It's too white.

152
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:33,349
The white background is too white

153
00:10:33,436 --> 00:10:35,437
The white background is okay

154
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:38,419
The white background is definitely

155
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:42,102
It's weakening the reflection

156
00:10:48,332 --> 00:10:51,267
Kazuha, your eyes are so shiny.

157
00:10:51,335 --> 00:10:52,336
Really?

158
00:10:55,544 --> 00:10:56,545
Really?

159
00:11:04,062 --> 00:11:05,003
No, really.

160
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:18,443
I wanna just
So the shot is considerate like this.

161
00:11:32,988 --> 00:11:38,478
As expected, I want to eat something
warm because it's getting a little chilly.

162
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:47,429
Recommend me ice cream. Ice cream.

163
00:11:48,794 --> 00:11:50,387
Pistachio ice cream.

164
00:11:50,734 --> 00:11:52,420
I ate that last time.

165
00:11:52,487 --> 00:11:54,422
The one at the convenience store.

166
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:56,028
What was it?

167
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:01,800
Dubai chocolate.

168
00:12:02,206 --> 00:12:05,270
Dubai chocolate ice cream.

169
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:08,434
It's sold out these days.

170
00:12:09,485 --> 00:12:11,213
Yunjin unnie told me about it.

171
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,066
It was good when I tried it.

172
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,653
To be honest, I don't really
know what Dubai chocolate is.

173
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:23,327
My teacher bought it for me and I ate it.

174
00:12:23,395 --> 00:12:24,441
So I tried it.

175
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,917
It was really good.

176
00:12:26,957 --> 00:12:27,844
Dubai chocolate.

177
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:30,690
Is Dubai chocolate popular in Japan?

178
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,180
Is it popular all over the world?

179
00:12:36,284 --> 00:12:37,847
I'm not sure.

180
00:12:53,393 --> 00:12:57,628
"I really want to eat chestnut tiramisu."

181
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:02,245
I think it will be really good.

182
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,643
I really respect it.

183
00:13:17,742 --> 00:13:19,195
Is it popular?

184
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:21,137
Does that mean it's already popular?

185
00:13:21,205 --> 00:13:23,139
Is it already popular?

186
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,106
You've seen it, right?

187
00:13:54,851 --> 00:13:56,659
I want to eat croissant

188
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,976
Unnie please do an impersonation of me

189
00:14:00,044 --> 00:14:01,572
Whose impersonation is it?

190
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,100
"I want to see short hair"

191
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:19,517
Short hair? I want to try it

192
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:20,714
I want to try it once.

193
00:14:20,781 --> 00:14:23,699
But if I do it, it will be a little...

194
00:14:24,536 --> 00:14:26,064
How should I say it?

195
00:14:26,404 --> 00:14:28,217
I think it will be a little embarrassing

196
00:14:30,534 --> 00:14:31,560
No

197
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:33,814
I think it will be a little embarrassing

198
00:14:38,249 --> 00:14:39,515
It's not like that

199
00:14:39,782 --> 00:14:41,343
I think my image will change

200
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,752
That's how it is.

201
00:14:49,262 --> 00:14:50,981
Honey, it's not a short hair

202
00:14:51,237 --> 00:14:53,490
It's not a short hair

203
00:14:56,718 --> 00:14:58,071
Fearnot you're so sure.

204
00:14:58,557 --> 00:14:59,722
All right, then.

205
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,723
Honesty.

206
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,034
Is there something in the back?

207
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:18,659
Ah

208
00:15:19,748 --> 00:15:21,749
Is it that again?

209
00:15:25,578 --> 00:15:27,571
Don't catch a cold

210
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:28,532
Yes

211
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,183
Fearnot, these days,

212
00:15:31,651 --> 00:15:33,324
The season is changing

213
00:15:33,578 --> 00:15:36,505
Please be careful of cold

214
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:38,766
My lighting

215
00:15:39,266 --> 00:15:41,035
It's gone

216
00:15:43,644 --> 00:15:44,952
Unnie, what's your height?

217
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:49,086
I haven't tried it lately

218
00:15:49,434 --> 00:15:50,659
170

219
00:15:52,323 --> 00:15:53,943
Isn't it 170?

220
00:15:54,011 --> 00:15:55,659
At the beginning of my debut

221
00:15:55,727 --> 00:15:56,628
What

222
00:15:56,695 --> 00:15:59,761
174?

223
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:02,408
I was surprised

224
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:04,739
It's not that tall

225
00:16:05,294 --> 00:16:07,075
170

226
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:14,225
Is it there or not?

227
00:16:17,157 --> 00:16:18,231
What should I say?

228
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:19,486
Shouldn't it be 170?

229
00:16:21,842 --> 00:16:23,985
I don't know if it's there or not.

230
00:16:25,271 --> 00:16:27,205
It's hard to say in Korean.

231
00:16:27,626 --> 00:16:29,560
I didn't go to an interview

232
00:16:38,881 --> 00:16:40,201
Is it there or not?

233
00:16:40,762 --> 00:16:41,941
170

234
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,428
Is it there or not?

235
00:16:44,739 --> 00:16:45,807
Please

236
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,248
170

237
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,872
"Are you taller than Eunchae?"

238
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:57,996
Wouldn't it be similar?

239
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,123
Isn't it similar?

240
00:17:02,191 --> 00:17:06,241
Or maybe Eunchae is a little bigger.

241
00:17:08,634 --> 00:17:10,312
What do I do?

242
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,240
My baby is tall.

243
00:17:25,103 --> 00:17:27,656
"Zuha, be careful of the bread."
Why are you being careful?

244
00:17:30,586 --> 00:17:34,982
"Next time when Eunchae's live is on"

245
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:37,136
Show... Show...

246
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,977
Show... Show...

247
00:17:39,398 --> 00:17:41,486
Comparison

248
00:17:41,553 --> 00:17:42,826
I'll do that.

249
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,551
Eunchae is a tall baby

250
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:01,793
Eunchae recently

251
00:18:33,094 --> 00:18:35,929
"Did you work out today?"
I did it before coming here,

252
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:40,212
but it's been a long time since
I've done it, so I'm really tired.

253
00:18:41,546 --> 00:18:46,237
It's really not easy to work out.

254
00:18:52,449 --> 00:18:58,132
I worked out thinking about
soy sauce marinated crab today.

255
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:07,056
I think I'll probably eat
with the members later.

256
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:13,356
I just thought about soy sauce
marinated crab and worked out.

257
00:19:15,102 --> 00:19:18,485
You know the hamstring thing?

258
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:20,011
It's that thing in the back.

259
00:19:20,438 --> 00:19:21,862
The machine that does this.

260
00:19:22,469 --> 00:19:27,412
I was doing that, and it gave me strength.

261
00:19:28,256 --> 00:19:31,132
As expected, the power of appetite.

262
00:19:32,116 --> 00:19:34,650
I recommend you do this.

263
00:19:35,488 --> 00:19:38,240
Think about what you
want to eat and exercise.

264
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:41,811
That way, it works out well.

265
00:20:16,755 --> 00:20:17,741
"MBTI?"

266
00:20:18,964 --> 00:20:21,515
I'm an INFP.

267
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:25,641
But I think I'm a bit of a T these days.

268
00:20:31,704 --> 00:20:33,852
Sometimes I feel like a T.

269
00:20:34,586 --> 00:20:37,035
I told Yunjin that.

270
00:20:37,349 --> 00:20:40,599
I said, I think I'm a T these days.

271
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:44,040
Yunjin said, but Zuha, do you know this?

272
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,488
F means I think I'm T

273
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:55,339
but T means I don't think I'm F

274
00:20:56,387 --> 00:20:59,340
So you're an F.

275
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:00,938
That's what she said.

276
00:21:01,006 --> 00:21:03,570
Oh, I see. Then I'm an F.

277
00:21:10,723 --> 00:21:12,162
I guess I'm an F.

278
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:14,204
I'm thinking about it.

279
00:21:14,271 --> 00:21:15,710
I guess I'm an F from now on.

280
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:22,665
Jeomhaechu?

281
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:24,734
Should I say Jeomhaechu?

282
00:21:27,728 --> 00:21:28,661
Fearnot.

283
00:21:28,936 --> 00:21:29,936
I want to eat meat.

284
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,458
What do you want to eat, Fearnot?

285
00:21:33,912 --> 00:21:34,846
I...

286
00:21:35,225 --> 00:21:37,269
Well...

287
00:21:43,018 --> 00:21:46,020
In Busan, Daegu,

288
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,736
I ate makjang and daechang.

289
00:21:52,324 --> 00:21:54,325
It was so good.

290
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:58,842
I used to like daechang a lot.

291
00:22:01,494 --> 00:22:03,431
Makjang and...

292
00:22:04,085 --> 00:22:05,370
I said daechang.

293
00:22:05,437 --> 00:22:06,337
Not daechang.

294
00:22:06,404 --> 00:22:07,879
Makjang and...

295
00:22:07,946 --> 00:22:09,205
What's makchang?

296
00:22:09,272 --> 00:22:11,987
Makchang and...

297
00:22:12,054 --> 00:22:14,653
No, not that.

298
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,506
Makchang and...

299
00:22:17,573 --> 00:22:19,898
What's makchang?

300
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,486
Tell me.

301
00:22:22,553 --> 00:22:23,859
Makchang...
Oh, right.

302
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:26,760
There's a makchang street in Daegu.

303
00:22:26,827 --> 00:22:27,973
Gopchang, makchang, daechang.

304
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,693
Oh, right.

305
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,872
I ate gopchang and makchang.

306
00:22:30,939 --> 00:22:32,954
It was really good.

307
00:22:33,021 --> 00:22:35,805
It was better than when I
ate it at the restaurant.

308
00:22:48,864 --> 00:22:50,868
To Fearnot,

309
00:22:53,086 --> 00:22:54,959
I recommend gopchang today.

310
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:09,504
Chipotle

311
00:23:09,572 --> 00:23:12,209
I saw Chipotle in Paris

312
00:23:12,277 --> 00:23:13,659
So...

313
00:23:14,534 --> 00:23:15,822
I was going to go

314
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:19,549
I wanted to go but I didn't

315
00:23:20,956 --> 00:23:23,639
I wanted to introduce it to my mom

316
00:23:23,988 --> 00:23:25,644
I wanted to introduce it to her

317
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:35,094
Did you have fun with the zip line?

318
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:39,612
Shh!

319
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:47,187
It's still a secret, right?

320
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,930
We know everything

321
00:24:03,116 --> 00:24:04,803
Right, Fearnot, knows everything

322
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,884
Really

323
00:24:17,554 --> 00:24:21,082
Capture time

324
00:24:30,489 --> 00:24:32,527
I don't know any poses these days

325
00:24:32,595 --> 00:24:34,045
What do you think?

326
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,573
Make a heart

327
00:24:39,264 --> 00:24:40,785
Click

328
00:24:40,852 --> 00:24:42,280
Flirting smile

329
00:24:46,301 --> 00:24:47,719
Ribbon heart

330
00:24:50,003 --> 00:24:52,203
The person who thought of
the ribbon heart is amazing.

331
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:58,645
What did you say?

332
00:24:58,713 --> 00:25:00,650
"It's a pose even if you stay still."

333
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,178
You're cool

334
00:25:05,941 --> 00:25:07,289
"Show me your cheek fat"

335
00:25:09,385 --> 00:25:10,384
Cheek fat

336
00:25:14,864 --> 00:25:16,426
Happy birthday

337
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,205
"Where's all the cheek fat?"

338
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,497
Where did it go?

339
00:25:34,405 --> 00:25:36,077
Okay

340
00:25:36,145 --> 00:25:38,414
I want to play with Fearnot for a while

341
00:25:39,564 --> 00:25:41,501
Wait

342
00:25:42,348 --> 00:25:44,285
I want to play with Fearnot for a while

343
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:46,383
I came

344
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,267
It's already been 25 minutes

345
00:25:48,334 --> 00:25:52,675
Really fast

346
00:25:54,317 --> 00:25:57,017
Something comes out at 5 o'clock

347
00:25:57,587 --> 00:25:59,524
Little bit

348
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:01,235
I don't think it's going to be like that.

349
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,878
So,

350
00:26:08,687 --> 00:26:11,330
I'll go now.

351
00:26:17,412 --> 00:26:18,560
Is it enough?

352
00:26:18,628 --> 00:26:21,147
I'm sure there's something big enough.

353
00:26:26,237 --> 00:26:28,682
Thank you for coming at this time.

354
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:31,379
See you again.

355
00:26:31,561 --> 00:26:32,563
From tomorrow.

356
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,094
No.

357
00:26:38,209 --> 00:26:39,910
Eat something delicious for dinner.

358
00:26:39,978 --> 00:26:40,824
Bye.

359
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:43,110
Bye. I'll have something delicious, too.

360
00:26:43,885 --> 00:26:45,077
Bye bye.

361
00:26:46,825 --> 00:26:47,827
I'll be back.
