00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,640
Hi

2
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:46,640
Hi. Hi, hi. Hi. What is it? It's me. Hi, hi.

3
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,640
If you have any questions for me, please ask. I'll answer them all.

4
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,640
I'm nervous, too.

5
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,640
I was just wondering if you had any questions for me.

6
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:29,640
It's me. What are you doing now? I washed up and finished everything.

7
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,000
Fireworks? I didn't see it.

8
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:00,640
I feel good because I scrubbed my body today.

9
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,640
What are you guys doing?

10
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,640
What are you guys doing?

11
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,640
I don't think there's anything.

12
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,640
Not everyone can see the tell-ing.

13
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:26,655
I think you can see it all.

14
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,022
Sing a song something crazy.

15
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,640
the alternative make me super crazy

16
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,640
It's home.

17
00:02:37,756 --> 00:02:38,940
How was Daegu?

18
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,640
It was really good.

19
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,640
It's been a long time since I've done a voice live, so it's not like that, is it?

20
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,640
Do you want me to give you a spoiler? What do you want me to give you a spoiler?

21
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,640
What?

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000


23
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,640
It was so much fun at the college festival.

24
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,640
We were promoting ON4.

25
00:03:03,492 --> 00:03:07,681
I did it then.

26
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,681
It's been a long time since I've done a college festival.

27
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,640
It was so much fun.

28
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,640
It was so much fun.

29
00:03:08,298 --> 00:03:10,308


30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000


31
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,640
Next song?

32
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,640
It's been a long time since I've done a college festival.

33
00:03:21,652 --> 00:03:23,652


34
00:03:27,558 --> 00:03:28,275


35
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,640
dialect?

36
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:34,693
It's really good.

37
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,640
It's really good.

38
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,640
It's really good.

39
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,640
Japanese?

40
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,640
Today, too...

41
00:03:41,894 --> 00:03:43,894


42
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,640
Piana...

43
00:03:50,015 --> 00:03:55,093
Today, too...

44
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,640
Today, too, fan signing...

45
00:03:55,094 --> 00:03:59,094


46
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:04,640
Thank you so much for coming to the fan signing event.

47
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Piana.

48
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
Am I right?

49
00:04:07,095 --> 00:04:08,350
Am I right?

50
00:04:08,521 --> 00:04:09,169
I don't know.

51
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:11,800
Isn't it Eun Chae?

52
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,640
Eun Chae.

53
00:04:12,558 --> 00:04:13,458
I'm the first.

54
00:04:13,565 --> 00:04:16,821
I did it first.

55
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:19,346


56
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,640
Eun Chae.

57
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,071
I did it first.

58
00:04:22,237 --> 00:04:23,096


59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000


60
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,096


61
00:04:27,973 --> 00:04:29,096
Crazy Red?

62
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,640
Back in the days.

63
00:04:29,097 --> 00:04:31,565
Don't be crazy.

64
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,640
You couldn't be crazy.

65
00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:35,273
I can't do it anymore.

66
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,640
Don't lie.

67
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,097
A word in Japanese for Kura.

68
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,640
Good morning.

69
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:40,406


70
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:45,323
Is it your birthday?

71
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
Who's birthday is it today?

72
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:47,415
Happy Birthday

73
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,640
Happy Birthday

74
00:04:48,798 --> 00:04:50,197
Happy Birthday

75
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
You're here on the Krayz on the year-end Saturday.

76
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,640
You're here on the year-end Saturday.

77
00:04:50,222 --> 00:04:51,608
Why?

78
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
Did you come out as a sea lion?

79
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:53,073


80
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,640
No way?

81
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
It's hard.

82
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,640
It's hard.

83
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,640
It's hard.

84
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,640
It's hard.

85
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
It's hard.

86
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
It's hard.

87
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
It's hard.

88
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,640
It's hard.

89
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,640
It's hard.

90
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,112
Oh, really?

91
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,341
Yoon Jin Ah's part?

92
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,200
Where is it?

93
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:13,295
Where did it come out?

94
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:17,987
I wrote a book on the neuron in my head.

95
00:05:25,306 --> 00:05:27,100
Oh, wait a minute. But I suddenly
wanted to eat cherries so much.

96
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:25,281
I ate meat today.

97
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,020
n th

98
00:05:44,963 --> 00:05:46,962
Is this a secret live broadcast?

99
00:05:46,987 --> 00:05:51,101
No, I'm not doing it in secret.

100
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,560
Be proud!

101
00:05:56,194 --> 00:05:58,614
You said you were going to sleep.

102
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,340
I want you to order cherries.

103
00:05:59,340 --> 00:05:59,960
He he.

104
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,520
No.

105
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:05,102
I'm going to play with the piano, eat a little cherries, and go to bed.

106
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,560
Ferrari girl, what's wrong with you?

107
00:06:24,105 --> 00:06:27,237
Kowakawa doesn't cry and speaks well.

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000


109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000


110
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:47,704
Cafe

111
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
Ferrari girl

112
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,560


113
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
I

114
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
I can't buy a Ferrari, everyone.

115
00:07:00,107 --> 00:07:03,429
I'm watching the drama that I recently watched now.

116
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,560
I'm watching it now.

117
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,560
I'm watching it now.

118
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,560
I'm watching it now.

119
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,560
I'm watching it now.

120
00:07:21,362 --> 00:07:23,298
I got it.

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,060
I got it.

122
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,560
I got it.

123
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,060
I got it.

124
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,400
I didn't see the black and white cook.

125
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,560
Black and white cook.

126
00:07:36,634 --> 00:07:38,042


127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,760
I don't know.

128
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,260
It's so much fun.

129
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:46,109
Everyone around me, including the members,

130
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,320
They say it's so much fun.

131
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,720
They're all talking about it.

132
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,120
Just copy it.

133
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,020
And if I say I haven't seen it yet,

134
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,380
You're still happy.

135
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,360
That's what I'm saying.

136
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,880
So I thought it was a cooking and judging program.

137
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,620
I haven't seen it yet.

138
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,160
I'm not interested in it yet.

139
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,080
My name is...

140
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,320
I want to cry.

141
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,380
I want to cry.

142
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,680
I want to cry.

143
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:30,317
Eun Chae is singing.

144
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,612
It's so cute.

145
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,240
The comments are so cute.

146
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,280
Eun Chae is singing.

147
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,040
Touch, touch, touch.

148
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000


149
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000


150
00:08:50,080 --> 00:09:00,540
I've tried my best to understand.

151
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:11,680
Please me too.

152
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,980
I don't know how to speak English well.

153
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:17,960
I can't just Estados.

154
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,320
Please me too.

155
00:09:22,193 --> 00:09:23,592
Please sing a celebrity song for me.

156
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,764
When I sang a celebrity song, I sang the lyrics of the song.

157
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,617
But I didn't know the lyrics of the song, so I can't remember the lyrics.

158
00:10:01,502 --> 00:10:02,529
That's it.

159
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,619


160
00:10:18,438 --> 00:10:19,573
Do you like General Hong Yi?

161
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,932


162
00:10:26,203 --> 00:10:27,728


163
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,250
Now I've called everything that starts with the name of the castle.

164
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,320
I borrowed it.

165
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
General Hong Yi.

166
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
Hongsam.

167
00:10:34,822 --> 00:10:40,079
Hong Gildong.

168
00:10:43,497 --> 00:10:44,496
You know, right?

169
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:49,421


170
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,320
Is that right?

171
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
China!

172
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000


173
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,320
Jinmemba.

174
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:02,975
Speak Chinese, please.
Thank you.

175
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
Uh.

176
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,320
I love you.

177
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,558
See you in China.

178
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,623


179
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:07,640
Please sing.

180
00:11:09,124 --> 00:11:10,536
You made me kiss me.

181
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:11,624


182
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,320
Uh?

183
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:15,300
 You may kiss me, na na na kiss me

184
00:11:22,206 --> 00:11:24,799
I don't know the lyrics

185
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:29,673
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na

186
00:11:29,698 --> 00:11:31,225
Please kiss me

187
00:11:32,397 --> 00:11:33,542
You may kiss me

188
00:11:39,675 --> 00:11:41,674
Happy birthday

189
00:11:42,072 --> 00:11:43,425
Oh, nemo nemo nemo nemo sign

190
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:48,543
Bunce munce

191
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000


192
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000


193
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000


194
00:11:54,568 --> 00:11:56,567
It's not a content if I sing

195
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000


196
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000


197
00:12:20,354 --> 00:12:22,354
I'm not in the mood to sleep soon?

198
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,437
 I'm still turning on all the lights in the room.

199
00:12:38,614 --> 00:12:42,429
What's your favorite nickname these days?

200
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,831
I'm Hoonchae.

201
00:12:56,482 --> 00:12:58,107
Who made that?

202
00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:01,556
I don't know.
Did you like it?

203
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:03,431
Hoon High School?

204
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
Dae-al?

205
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,320
It's not Dae-al.

206
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,320
I'm sorry.

207
00:13:17,306 --> 00:13:18,598
Eun-chae like Hoon?

208
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:19,948
No.

209
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:21,781
It's Hoon Hoon-han Eun-chae.

210
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
Isn't it?

211
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,432
It's Hoon Hoon-han Eun-chae, so it's called Hoonchae.

212
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,320
Hoon-hee Eun-chae?

213
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:29,975
Are you making fun of me now?

214
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:39,817
Eun-chae going to the training center?

215
00:13:40,092 --> 00:13:41,433
What are you talking about?

216
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:53,649


217
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:55,125


218
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,434
Is it Hoon Hoon-han?

219
00:14:02,746 --> 00:14:04,388


220
00:14:18,832 --> 00:14:21,471
I miss you, Eun-chae.

221
00:14:24,956 --> 00:14:26,436
I miss you, too.

222
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,320
Eun-chae, you're so cute.

223
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,320
Why do you remember the three name clubs in the nickname?

224
00:14:27,627 --> 00:14:30,717
Why are you so cute?

225
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,320
I like cartoons.

226
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,320
Do you like cartoons?

227
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,320
Do you like cartoons?

228
00:14:36,431 --> 00:14:41,019
I don't watch cartoons much.

229
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Do you like cartoons?

230
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,320
Do you like cartoons?

231
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,320
Do you like cartoons?

232
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Yes.

233
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,320
Wait.

234
00:14:48,162 --> 00:14:53,439
Eun-chae.

235
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
Say something to the older sisters in a white hoodie.

236
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
What is this?

237
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,020
Ah, what is this? For real.

238
00:14:55,273 --> 00:15:00,029
What is this? What is it?

239
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:05,737
What? What should I do?

240
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,920
That white hoodie was really amazing.

241
00:15:06,004 --> 00:15:11,583
I could only see that one.

242
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,440
It's really funny.

243
00:15:18,094 --> 00:15:20,440
You bought it? Really? A white hoodie.

244
00:15:20,441 --> 00:15:22,646
Ah, really.

245
00:15:24,325 --> 00:15:26,569
It's not a plotting.

246
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,015


247
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,120
It's crazy, right? It's red, right?

248
00:15:30,498 --> 00:15:34,441


249
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
Why?

250
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,120
Why? What?

251
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:39,441
To be exact, it's not white.

252
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,441
You know that bright gray?

253
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:47,442


254
00:15:47,443 --> 00:15:48,633
It's not gray, but it's really bright gray.

255
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,418
It was a hoodie.

256
00:15:48,658 --> 00:15:50,077


257
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,620
That's why it's called a hoodie.

258
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,620
Really funny.

259
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000


260
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000


261
00:16:15,046 --> 00:16:21,355


262
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,620
I saw it in detail.

263
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000


264
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,620
I didn't see it in detail, but she was sitting in the first row.

265
00:16:23,004 --> 00:16:25,890
I'm not plotting,
I'm really going

266
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:29,445
to explain what it is, everyone.

267
00:16:30,377 --> 00:16:33,445
Don't say anything and listen. I'll explain.

268
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:40,620
You want me to speak like Hachu Pink? I'll explain.

269
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:47,447
It's been a long time since we had a university event, and there were schools that went far away.

270
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:58,873
We're on stage, but we're getting a lot of good energy and a lot of good things.

271
00:16:59,773 --> 00:17:02,423
We prepared our signed album for each school.

272
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:10,620
I wanted to pick someone who enjoyed it so much and give them a gift, so I prepared a signed album.

273
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:20,797


274
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,620
Uh...

275
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,620
Now...

276
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:25,620
It's time to pick someone to give the signed album, right?

277
00:17:21,222 --> 00:17:23,393


278
00:17:26,371 --> 00:17:29,083
But...

279
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,620
I...

280
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:39,529
To start the anti...

281
00:17:42,052 --> 00:17:49,315
But there are so many people now.

282
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,620
It was really hard to pick two or three people for this signed album.

283
00:17:50,544 --> 00:17:53,450
So, it's really hard to choose.

284
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,620
Ah, I actually...

285
00:17:59,648 --> 00:18:00,451
From the moment I came up on stage, I saw her.

286
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,620
There's a sister.

287
00:18:00,476 --> 00:18:03,872
I said, and that's how it happened.

288
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,620
Everyone...

289
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:08,025
You talked too long.

290
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,620
I'm sorry.

291
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,620
I'm sorry.

292
00:18:14,962 --> 00:18:16,875
I'm sorry.

293
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,620
I'm sorry.

294
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,620
I'm sorry.

295
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:18,452
I'm sorry.

296
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

297
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,369


298
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,681
No, I'm not.

299
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,620
What's the next stage name?

300
00:18:29,058 --> 00:18:30,402


301
00:18:34,574 --> 00:18:39,708
And since it's a college festival,

302
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,620
If you're a college student, you're older than me.

303
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:46,631
And the fact that you're in the first row means that you're a college student in that school.

304
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:50,415
And I have a lot of affection for you.

305
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000


306
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:15,860


307
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,620
Everyone, let's talk about something else.

308
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,620
What is your favorite member?

309
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,620
It's not that I have affection for you,

310
00:19:21,737 --> 00:19:25,785
I just wanted to treat you like a family.

311
00:19:27,658 --> 00:19:32,835
And we're all the same age.

312
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,620
I wanted to treat you like a family.

313
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,620
I'm sorry.

314
00:19:33,494 --> 00:19:36,121
I'm sorry.

315
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,620
I'm sorry.

316
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,620
I'm sorry.

317
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,533
WILM SHI

318
00:20:01,775 --> 00:20:02,625
Oh,

319
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,900
I don't cry.

320
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000


321
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:15,536


322
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,200
Q.!

323
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,760
Do you have friends with 06?

324
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000


325
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,760
96?

326
00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:38,065


327
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:42,304


328
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:42,729
I think it's the last one.

329
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000


330
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000


331
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,760
It's October's birthday.

332
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:08,784
It's October 27th.

333
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,760
Congratulations.

334
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,760
Congratulations, Miri.

335
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,760
Congratulations, Miri.

336
00:21:16,785 --> 00:21:17,996
Are you listening?

337
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000


338
00:21:21,793 --> 00:21:23,792
Congratulations, Miri.

339
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:25,786
It's still October 5th.

340
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,786


341
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,760
It's October's birthday.

342
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000


343
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000


344
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,760
Congratulations, everyone.

345
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,760
Do you have anything you want to do?

346
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,760
Do you have a challenge you want to do?

347
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,760
A challenge you want to do?

348
00:21:55,987 --> 00:21:57,987
I want to do a touch challenge.

349
00:21:59,446 --> 00:22:01,446
I want to do a touch challenge.

350
00:22:03,025 --> 00:22:04,787
What's the new challenge?

351
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,760
What is the new gender dance challenge to komen?

352
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,760
What is the new girl's challenge?

353
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,760
Hi.

354
00:22:15,589 --> 00:22:17,789
Nemo Nemo Nemo Nemo

355
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,140

357
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:40,156

360
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,760
Maru? Maru Kung Kung

361
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,760
I did Maru Kung Kung Challenge

362
00:22:48,432 --> 00:22:49,752


363
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,760
What is Umbrini?

364
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,760
What is Umbrini?

365
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,760

369
00:23:18,986 --> 00:23:20,732


370
00:23:20,756 --> 00:23:23,453


371
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,760
There are a lot of people doing that

372
00:23:30,672 --> 00:23:33,097


373
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,760
Im Ho Jung-ssi

374
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,760
I know I know

375
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,760
I'm glad.

376
00:24:07,774 --> 00:24:08,933
It's going to be cut off?

377
00:24:11,438 --> 00:24:14,438
I wasn't talking yet.

378
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,600


379
00:24:19,268 --> 00:24:20,797
The weather is really nice.

380
00:24:21,939 --> 00:24:23,798
The weather is nice.

381
00:24:29,689 --> 00:24:31,797
What movie do you recommend?

382
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,760
For me,

383
00:24:32,964 --> 00:24:36,799


384
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:43,798
It's a movie that's not serious at all.

385
00:24:44,615 --> 00:24:47,615
It's a cute and fun movie.

386
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:51,602


387
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
There's a movie called Yes Day.

388
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,333
Was I really in elementary school?

389
00:24:56,345 --> 00:25:00,800
I think it's a movie that my teacher showed me in class.

390
00:25:03,147 --> 00:25:07,800
My family

391
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,760
once a year?

392
00:25:07,801 --> 00:25:09,800


393
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,760
It's called Yes Day.

394
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,760
So that day,

395
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,760
No matter what,

396
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,760
I can only say yes.

397
00:25:16,801 --> 00:25:18,801


398
00:25:18,802 --> 00:25:20,802


399
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,760
So once a year

400
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,760
On that day,

401
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,760
I really wanted to do it.

402
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,760
There's something I can't even imagine.

403
00:25:29,552 --> 00:25:30,801
Buy ice cream and eat it.

404
00:25:33,335 --> 00:25:35,335
It's a day to try something like this.

405
00:25:36,362 --> 00:25:37,802
Because I can only say yes, I have to follow everything.

406
00:25:41,377 --> 00:25:43,802
Well, anyway, there's a lot of movies like that.

407
00:25:43,803 --> 00:25:45,156
So it's just cute and not really serious.

408
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,637
Just when you're bored.

409
00:26:08,641 --> 00:26:09,805
Yes, I like it.

410
00:26:18,146 --> 00:26:21,789


411
00:26:22,629 --> 00:26:25,805


412
00:26:26,762 --> 00:26:30,601


413
00:26:31,956 --> 00:26:34,956


414
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,120
It's so...

415
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,000
That's...

416
00:26:42,787 --> 00:26:44,687
I was surprised.

417
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:48,470


418
00:26:48,897 --> 00:26:52,607
But just like...

419
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,900
Just like others.

420
00:26:52,608 --> 00:26:55,235
I'm just going to get the ticket myself.

421
00:26:55,927 --> 00:27:02,268
I can't get a witness.

422
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,760
I didn't think I could get a ticket.

423
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,760
I didn't think I could get a ticket.

424
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,760
But I didn't know there would be so many articles.

425
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,760
Really.

426
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:09,627
I was so embarrassed.

427
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,760
I'm so...

428
00:27:09,652 --> 00:27:14,081
I'm really bad at self-makeup.

429
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,760
I'm really bad at self-makeup.

430
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,760
I'm really good at self-makeup.

431
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,685
It was fun.

432
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,760
But I won.

433
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:25,569
The weather was really nice.

434
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,760
It was so much fun.

435
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,760
Really.

436
00:27:34,225 --> 00:27:42,332
The父 et

437
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000


438
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,760
And just for fun.

439
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,385


440
00:27:46,661 --> 00:27:49,428


441
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,760
Just for fun.

442
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,760
My brother and I.

443
00:27:52,675 --> 00:27:57,371
It's kind of a cliff.

444
00:27:57,479 --> 00:27:59,951
So I won all of them, and I filmed it in time-lapse mode.

445
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:07,560


446
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,060
It's so funny.

447
00:28:07,673 --> 00:28:08,874
And what else?

448
00:28:12,668 --> 00:28:14,343
And I just met a lot of family members.

449
00:28:20,294 --> 00:28:27,404
Not just my mom and dad, but also my relatives. I met a lot of relatives this time.

450
00:28:36,403 --> 00:28:38,578
There are families that
I see often, but there

451
00:28:38,886 --> 00:28:41,645
are also people that I
haven't seen in years.

452
00:28:41,895 --> 00:28:43,927
I think I've met a lot of family members.

453
00:28:47,331 --> 00:28:51,135
The picture of the moon...

454
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,500
It was near the sea near Sokcho.

455
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:57,420
I took a picture of the moon when I was on my way home from Sokcho.

456
00:28:57,322 --> 00:29:01,656
I started bowling, too.

457
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,200
My bowling family...

458
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,697
Me, Eun-chae, In-cheol, Seok-oun, In- demonstrations took whole day.

459
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:18,560
Screen cap!

460
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:18,720
There is an importantOverodge.

461
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:18,820
I think I might be able to match it in a few years.

462
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:18,840
I think I might be able to match it in a few years.

463
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:21,885


464
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,492


465
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:30,865


466
00:29:32,052 --> 00:29:35,578
A baseball cheering song?

467
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,840
I sang the cheering song really hard that day.

468
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,840
I sang along to all of them.

469
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:44,025
But I forgot because I didn't go.

470
00:29:48,575 --> 00:29:51,580


471
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000


472
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,840
Doosan.

473
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,840
Together with Seungri.

474
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,840
Doosan.

475
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000


476
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000


477
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,840
Doosan.

478
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,580


479
00:30:11,605 --> 00:30:13,605
How do I know all of them?

480
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000


481
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,840
That's Crazy.

482
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000


483
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000


484
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000


485
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000


486
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000


487
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000


488
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000


489
00:30:36,132 --> 00:30:43,559
It's been a while since I worked out.

490
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,840
It's been a while since I worked out.

491
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,840
First diagnostics.

492
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,840
First.

493
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,840
I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything at all, so I worked out.

494
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000


495
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000


496
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000


497
00:31:05,585 --> 00:31:08,790
Yes, I did a lot when I did it, but it's been a while since I did it again.

498
00:31:09,561 --> 00:31:12,340
It's so hard to start over.

499
00:31:12,365 --> 00:31:15,198


500
00:31:47,537 --> 00:31:48,815
I want to go again.

501
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,840
But I really want to go to the baseball field again.

502
00:31:54,795 --> 00:31:56,683


503
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,840
I want to go to the baseball field again.

504
00:31:57,589 --> 00:32:02,014
It's a shame, but I really have to go next year.

505
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,840
I really have to go next year.

506
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,447


507
00:32:20,477 --> 00:32:21,589
It was really amazing. It was a fun game.

508
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000


509
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000


510
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000


511
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,093
I posted it on Instagram.

512
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,840
Wow, it's been 30 minutes.

513
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,840
It's been 30 minutes.

514
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,840
It's so cool.

515
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000


516
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,840
I...

517
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:39,270
I can't help it, but I feel sad.

518
00:33:47,647 --> 00:33:49,962
Even if it was raining, I think it would have been like that.

519
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:53,719
I just came to play today.

520
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000


521
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,840
It was fun, right?

522
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,840
What are you doing?

523
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000


524
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000


525
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,840
I always forget and always ask this.

526
00:34:54,840 --> 00:35:00,840
The fans asked me so much about the Japanese I learned recently.

527
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,840
Now, how can I talk to my sisters?

528
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:03,740
If there's a new Japanese I'm listening to, I'm trying to memorize it.

529
00:35:04,138 --> 00:35:08,591
If I memorize it and ask you

530
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:14,135
later, I'll answer
you like this.

531
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,840
That's what I do.

532
00:35:14,463 --> 00:35:17,463
Oh, but I really forgot again.

533
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,840
There was something.

534
00:35:22,103 --> 00:35:22,738
Do you know what a seal is in Japanese?

535
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,923
It was a seal.

536
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,840
What's a seal?

537
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,840
What was it?

538
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,840
I always remember this because it's so dark.

539
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,840
After I came, I was a cotton candy.

540
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,840
It's a seal.

541
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,840
What was the name of the seal you noticed in Jini?

542
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:57,840
I removed it because I said it after going to school.

543
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,340
But you were very serious.

544
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,340
Oh, yeah.

545
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,840
Oh, hello!

546
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,840
i know.

547
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,840
Oh, it was about dance.

548
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,825
That's it. I think it was Azarath.

549
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,840
What's your favorite snack these days?

550
00:36:16,826 --> 00:36:20,285
I really like fried rice cakes and nurungji these days.

551
00:36:20,535 --> 00:36:21,826
Nurungji. I like nurungji and fried rice cakes.

552
00:36:25,927 --> 00:36:31,054
My manager bought me a really good fried rice cake yesterday.

553
00:36:32,537 --> 00:36:34,615
It was really good.

554
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:41,840
Me and my manager and two other people ate it together.

555
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:46,840
You know, the long bag of fried rice cakes is usually sold in long bags.

556
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,840
I ate it all.

557
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,840
I ate it all on the spot.

558
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,840
It wasn't a human fried rice cake.

559
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,840
It's really good to put in your mouth.

560
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,840
It's really thin and sweet and savory.

561
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,840
It was really good.

562
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:09,840
It was really good.

563
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:12,355
How are you doing?

564
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,244
Isn't it almost 12 o'clock?

565
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,840
You should go to bed.

566
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
Eunchi, I'm going to bed.

567
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,840
All right.

568
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
I'm going to sleep.

569
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,840
Of course, I'm going to eat cherries and sleep.

570
00:37:37,432 --> 00:37:42,467
I'm going to eat cherries and sleep, but you guys should go to bed early.

571
00:37:43,773 --> 00:37:44,772
All right?

572
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,840
Did you have fun today?

573
00:37:44,797 --> 00:37:46,075


574
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,840
I guess the cherries are all here.

575
00:37:51,434 --> 00:37:52,465
That's right. We're almost there.

576
