1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hello, hello, hello.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hello, hello, hello.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I brought some rice.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I know.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Mi is...

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I know.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I know, right?

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I've never been on the show before.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I want to be on the show someday.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm eating salt bread.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm eating salt bread.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's been a long time since I've been on the show.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
When was it?

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
During the promotion.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It was the last time I did it for a short time.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Where did it go?

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Someone said it was fun at the fan signing event yesterday.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's great.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Thank you for going to the fan signing event today.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Thank you for coming to the fan signing event today.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Thank you so much, everyone.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What should I say?

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
After the fan signing event today...

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And...

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I was shooting a video for a content.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Why a practice room? Is it a concert?

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I think you have to wait a little longer for a concert.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You have to have a lot of songs to make it different.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So...

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I asked a lot of questions today.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Even during the fan signing event.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Wait a little longer.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll do my best for the end of the year stage.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I heard that there was a fireworks party at the Han River today.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
A fireworks party?

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It wasn't a party.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It wasn't that big of a party.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Is it a fireworks festival?

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So I went up to the rooftop.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I came to see it with the managers.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's a festival, right?

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It was amazing.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Really?

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's been a while since I saw it.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The fireworks...

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I saw it properly.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Since I was a student...

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Since I was a student...

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I saw it a lot when I was in my teens.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I think...

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
If I have a summer vacation,

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I go to see it with my family.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I saw it a lot when I was an idol.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I saw it a lot when I was an idol.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I saw it a lot when I was an idol.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I saw it a lot when I was an idol.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Did you cry?

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Wow, there's someone who knows me from a long time ago.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I didn't cry, but the sound was really loud.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I didn't cry, but the sound was really loud.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So I was a little scared.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Except for that, it was okay.

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It was so pretty.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Something...

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm not the kind of person who just looks pretty.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm not the kind of person who just looks pretty.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So I wondered Some Korean people us watching this fireworks together.

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So I wondered Some Korean people us watching this fireworks together.

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So I wondered Some Korean people us watching this fireworks together.

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So I wondered Some Korean people us watching this fireworks together.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What kind of person would be there to watch this fireworks next year?

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What kind of person would be there to watch this fireworks next year?

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What kind of person would be there to watch this fireworks next year?

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I was thinking like this.

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It was pretty, right?

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Just now, um...

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
There was a fireworks competition at the Han river.

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
There was a fireworks competition at the Han river.

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We watched it with ourimmigrant height.

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
with ourimmigrant height.

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Ah, right.

85
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I get asked a lot about where I got the packs for the punishment game.

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
For now,

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I can't do it in front of people who don't know the rules.

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So I decided to do it at Weverse Live.

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'll do it someday.

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I had a pack in Portugal.

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I was so nervous to do it in front of other fans who don't know the rules.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I always had a schedule.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I was already wearing makeup when I got to work.

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I couldn't do it on the way to work.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I decided to do it at Weverse Live.

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Please understand.

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And I wanted to show you my pretty face on the way to work.

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So...

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Okay.

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It wasn't easy.

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It wasn't easy for me and Eunchi compared to other members.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'll do it next time.

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Did you see the fireworks?

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It was so pretty.

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I ate rice.

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I ate soup.

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I ate crumb chowder.

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Long time no see.

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I ate it simply.

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I ate it after I got off work.

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I ate it simply.

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Can I do what I want to hear?

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Eunchi's voice.

114
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm the leader.

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm a leader, too.

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It was my belief.

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
No one guessed I was serious.

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I've never done it before, but I'm trying hard these days.

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Vol.1

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It doesn't matter if you didn't do it from the beginning.

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Come on.

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And now...

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Sabrina Carpenter was on the live show.

124
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It was so pretty.

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Did you see that, everyone?

126
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I think some people don't know.

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Like this.

128
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Wait.

129
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I want to explain it properly.

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
At Sabrina's concert,

131
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
At the concert,

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
At first,

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I came with the concept of being a little late.

134
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So I'm covering my clothes like this.

135
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I know, I know.

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Does anyone know?

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I came like this.

138
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Show me like this.

139
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I was so scared.

140
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And then I saw it like this.

141
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The microphone didn't come out.

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm doing this.

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But I throughout,

144
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,800
Everything

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Everything is so lovely.

146
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
How can we be so lovely?

147
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Anybody who knows it, can understand me completely.

148
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Do you know?

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Through tik-tok.

150
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Recently.

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
There's people who do challenges.

152
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'll do it later.

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Let's go.

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
This song is really...

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We took a vacation this time.

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I went to Hawaii with my family.

157
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I went to the beach at night.

158
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The beach is right in front of the hotel.

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
There's a place where you can lie down.

160
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I was listening to this song while lying down there.

161
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I was listening to the lyrics of Sanurina.

162
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I think Sanurina's lyrics are really cute.

163
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I think Sanurina's lyrics are really cute.

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I think Sanurina's lyrics are really cute.

165
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
She's cute.

166
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You can't hate her.

167
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
We were so cute.

168
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It was so cute.

169
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll turn it off for a moment.

170
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:48,300
When I went to Hawaii on vacation, I listened to this song all the time.

171
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,500
It's not burnt at all.

172
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,200
My hands are really burnt.

173
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,400
I didn't burn much in other places.

174
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,400
Well, it's a little burnt, but my hands are burning.

175
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,200
My hands are burning.

176
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
I don't know.

177
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
I like Sabrina too.

178
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
I want to go to the concert.

179
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,200
This Sabrina set is so cute.

180
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,200
It was so nice to sing while sitting on the heart.

181
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
It was good.

182
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
I bought a VN-made one.

183
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,000
I bought a set.

184
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I went to VN.

185
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The set was so...

186
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's really...

187
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,200
I have two.

188
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,000
If I do it on this side, it leads to this side.

189
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Suddenly, I have a different house.

190
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The set was really amazing.

191
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It was really awesome.

192
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Then, something.

193
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It felt like we were watching a movie together, so it was amazing.

194
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
During VMAs.

195
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It wasn't our stage, but the stage at the awards ceremony.

196
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The stage we were watching.

197
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It was amazing.

198
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm wearing this because I wanted to talk about our vacation.

199
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Shall we talk about our vacation?

200
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It was our first vacation, right?

201
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:44,000
When I was young, there was this thing about Japanese people.

202
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
If you say vacation, it means Hawaii.

203
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's a must.

204
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
There's something like that.

205
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Something like that.

206
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
There's something like that too.

207
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
When celebrities go on vacation, it's Hawaii.

208
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Since I was in elementary school,

209
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
since I was really young,

210
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
there was something like that.

211
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The atmosphere was like that.

212
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So I had to go on vacation.

213
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
When I heard that there was going to be a vacation this time,

214
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I was like, I have to go to Hawaii.

215
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I told my mom right away.

216
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Mom, I think I have to go to Hawaii.

217
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I've never been there.

218
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This vacation is in Hawaii.

219
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So I went.

220
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'll say it in Japanese.

221
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
When I was told that I was going to take a vacation for the first time,

222
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I was like, vacation?

223
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What do you call it?

224
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Vacation equals...

225
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The vacation of a celebrity equals Hawaii.

226
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's been like that for a long time.

227
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's just my imagination.

228
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I've never been to Hawaii.

229
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I thought I'd definitely go to Hawaii on my first vacation.

230
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So I went to Hawaii.

231
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So in terms of being in Hawaii,

232
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Um...

233
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
At first,

234
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
There was a hotel called Kahara Hotel.

235
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
There was a hotel where they were raising dolphins at the hotel.

236
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's about 7 minutes away from Waikiki.

237
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
There aren't many people there.

238
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
From the hotel to the swimming pool and the beach,

239
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's all connected.

240
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
They're raising dolphins next to the pool.

241
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So you can just see the dolphins.

242
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
If you make a reservation there,

243
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
From 9 p.m.

244
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You can experience it.

245
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You can swim with the dolphins.

246
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You can play with the dolphins.

247
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
There's something like that.

248
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So I made a reservation for that, too.

249
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Right.

250
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And there's a restaurant in the hotel.

251
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's a really famous restaurant.

252
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Just in Hawaii.

253
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So there,

254
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I had a meal.

255
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It was really good.

256
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So after that,

257
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What was it?

258
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
On the first day,

259
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I don't remember.

260
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Wait a minute.

261
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Oh, right.

262
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
On the first day,

263
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
This is...

264
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's really...

265
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's my first time.

266
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Anyone can see it.

267
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
One person came to Hawaii for the first time.

268
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
on which I is the highest number of domestic дв.

269
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm the one.

270
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
There was a tree that goes down.

271
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Everyone crispy but

272
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
There was a good książi.

273
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So I wanted to be a person who's always tired,

274
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That's not what I mean.

275
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I think it's something I learned.

276
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
As a part of the trip,

277
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I wanted to feel like that.

278
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I want to go before I know.

279
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Everybody looks famous.

280
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I even ate it.

281
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What did I do on the first day?

282
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,400
I really don't remember, all of a sudden

283
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,200
First, I did that

284
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
And the next day

285
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
I went on a snowmobile

286
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
I went on a yacht

287
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,000
I think it was a gecko

288
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I went quite far

289
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And there

290
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I used a goggle

291
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And I saw the sea

292
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And I swam with the fish

293
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And there was a turtle

294
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
There was a normal turtle

295
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But we couldn't approach it

296
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
But if we approached it

297
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
We could see it from a distance

298
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
We could see it from a distance

299
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I experienced that

300
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I did a lot of things, so I don't remember

301
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It was really fun

302
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I saw a turtle

303
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And I did a test with a turtle

304
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And

305
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I didn't really surf the surfboard

306
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I got on the surfboard

307
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And

308
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I did something like this

309
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Like a canoe

310
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The picture was frozen

311
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But I did that

312
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But I'm not really good at it

313
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
But

314
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
My mom

315
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I went with my dad

316
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I was going to go with my dad

317
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But my dad couldn't go

318
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So we went together

319
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But

320
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Are you okay now?

321
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Are you worried?

322
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
My dad is the best at English

323
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But

324
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I couldn't do it

325
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So I was like

326
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What should I do?

327
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I had no choice but to speak English

328
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
So I tried my best

329
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
But

330
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
When I was on the surfboard

331
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
When I was on the surfboard

332
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I was at the same time as the Korean

333
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I was at the same time as the Korean

334
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I made a reservation at the same time

335
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So

336
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
They didn't recognize me

337
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But I kept speaking in Korean

338
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And they were good at English

339
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So I spoke in English

340
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But my English was a bit fast

341
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So I couldn't understand it

342
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I took a picture

343
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But I didn't know if I should use USB

344
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Or SD card

345
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So it was hard

346
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So I asked them in Korean

347
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
What do you do in English?

348
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
What do you do in English?

349
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Can you translate it for me?

350
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I asked them in Korean

351
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
They were surprised

352
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
They were surprised

353
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I was living in Korea

354
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I can speak Korean

355
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
They were surprised

356
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So we had a 3-part conversation

357
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
They were surprised

358
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I explained in Japanese

359
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
My mom answered

360
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I was speaking in Korean

361
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And the Korean people

362
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Translated it into English

363
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
There were many languages

364
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
There were many languages

365
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I am so glad I could speak in Korean

366
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I was so glad I could speak in Korean

367
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
They said

368
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
they like traveling

369
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
They said they went to Fukuoka

370
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
They said Fukuoka is my hometown

371
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
They said Fukuoka is my hometown

372
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
We had a conversation

373
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It was fun

374
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It was amazing

375
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It was really hard for me to speak English, because I was the only one who could speak English.

376
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,000
My younger brother could speak English, but he said he didn't want to speak English because he was too shy.

377
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
So I had to speak English.

378
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
My younger brother speaks English, too.

379
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
When I was young, I went to a kindergarten that spoke English.

380
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's how it was.

381
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And I'm still learning at school.

382
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So I can do simple things, but he kept saying he was too shy.

383
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So I had no choice but to do it.

384
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But he understood.

385
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It was fun.

386
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You saw all the pictures, right?

387
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Most of them were taken by my younger brother.

388
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
My mom is really good at taking pictures.

389
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Seriously.

390
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Seriously.

391
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I can't help it.

392
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
There are things that people are good at and things that they're not good at.

393
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
She's such a pretty girl, but she wants to take pictures like this.

394
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
She's really good at taking pictures.

395
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Really.

396
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
So I told my mom,

397
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Oh, please.

398
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Mom, try taking a picture of me like this.

399
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I set the angle.

400
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Mom, mom, now, now.

401
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You know this angle, right?

402
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
But my mom moved again.

403
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So I tried to teach her well, but there was a difficulty.

404
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
My brother kept watching it next to me.

405
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So I said,

406
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Oh, then take a picture of my brother.

407
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
So I took a picture of him.

408
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But he's good at taking pictures.

409
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
He was watching it right next to me.

410
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
He understood everything I said.

411
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So I took a picture of my brother.

412
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
But the funny thing is,

413
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I posted it on Instagram.

414
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Then my mom suddenly called me and said,

415
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But I think I took a good picture.

416
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So I said, Mom, that's almost a picture of my brother.

417
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Oh, really?

418
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
No.

419
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Then my brother next to me said,

420
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Oh, I took all of these pictures.

421
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I took a picture of my brother and sent them to him.

422
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
He took a picture of my brother better than I thought.

423
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I really can't take pictures of my mom.

424
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Really.

425
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's really bad.

426
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's a picture I like to take.

427
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I was in the middle.

428
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Even if I say I'm in the middle of the video,

429
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
it's hard for me.

430
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
So I was asked to take pictures of my brother.

431
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It was fun.

432
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's been a while since I played with Nam Do-eun.

433
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I used to play with her a lot when she was a baby.

434
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
But I never played with her properly after she became a student.

435
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
When she came to Tokyo, I used to look at her face a lot.

436
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
But it was my first time seeing her for a long time.

437
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So it was fun to talk to her.

438
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I don't want Kim Wh tantalum anymore.

439
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You're still as young as me.

440
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You're little.

441
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You look really calm now.

442
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You want me to face the camera?

443
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm so embarrassed to film at this stage.

444
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Are you interested in being a cameraman?

445
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But I think it's fun to do my own thing.

446
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I want to try this hairstyle.

447
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Teacher, why are you so shy?

448
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I guess it's not like that.

449
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
But I was even more shy.

450
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It wasn't like that when I was in middle school.

451
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
When I was in elementary school,

452
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I went out to eat.

453
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
My mom would ask me to say hello.

454
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So that I could say hello properly.

455
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But I was so mean.

456
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I was so shy.

457
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I cried there.

458
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I was so shy.

459
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
My mom said I was too shy.

460
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So I went to learn musicals.

461
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
That was the beginning.

462
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So when I saw you,

463
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I thought you were better than me.

464
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You were so mean.

465
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Now I'm not shy anymore.

466
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
You were so mean back then.

467
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You were like that when you were young.

468
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You were fine.

469
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
But it doesn't mean that I'm still the same.

470
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
But when I tried it,

471
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I realized that

472
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I was so different from when I was young.

473
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Even though I had different environment.

474
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So I don't worry too much.

475
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm young.

476
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
But people...

477
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It's all the same when you're young.

478
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
We're learning more and more.

479
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I think.

480
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,500
When I went to Hawaii, there were a lot of people who recognized me.

481
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,600
Even if it wasn't a Korean or Japanese person,

482
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,500
various people recognized me.

483
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,500
They spoke to me in English.

484
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,500
I went to a steak restaurant. It's really famous.

485
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,000
It's famous in Hawaii.

486
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
What's the name?

487
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Jaws? Jaws? Jays?

488
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
It's a steak restaurant.

489
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
The staff there said,

490
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Are you Sakura?

491
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
It was so amazing.

492
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
My mom saw it and said she was touched.

493
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
My daughter recognized me no matter where I went.

494
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
That's how much she recognized me.

495
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It's not like that.

496
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
It's amazing.

497
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
But she recognized me in English.

498
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
She spoke to me in English.

499
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So it was amazing.

500
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It was amazing for me, too.

501
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Where do you want to go after the members?

502
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
After the members?

503
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
After the members, it would be fun to go anywhere.

504
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
If I get a vacation next time,

505
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I want to go to Jeju Island.

506
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I want to go nearby.

507
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Or I want to go to Hawaii again.

508
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I love Hawaii.

509
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
If I get a vacation next time,

510
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I want to go to a nearby place.

511
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I want to go to Jeju Island.

512
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Or I want to go to Hawaii again.

513
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
A warm place feels like a vacation destination.

514
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I like cold places, too.

515
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
But it's a little...

516
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
There's a lot of luggage.

517
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Do you know what I mean?

518
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
The carrier ends with clothes.

519
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
But if you go to a warm place,

520
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
You can just take a t-shirt or a dress.

521
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
You can just take a thin dress.

522
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I like a warm place.

523
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It was a very tea-like comment.

524
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Right?

525
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I think you know what I mean.

526
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm a realistic person.

527
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Because there are a lot of things I want to buy.

528
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
If I just put on a padded jacket, it's over.

529
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
That's too slow.

530
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
If I have a magazine in Japan...

531
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Did you know this year?

532
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
You don't, do you?

533
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Please wait a little longer.

534
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
A little more.

535
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I bought this hat because it's too cute.

536
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I want to see you wearing it.

537
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:27,000
There were a lot of people who wore it today.

538
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
This is Ego's wink.

539
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Congratulations.

540
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Black and white girls are so popular these days.

541
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I haven't seen it yet.

542
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It's really fun.

543
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I only know what the members are talking about because I haven't seen it yet.

544
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I'll think about it.

545
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I'll think about it for a while.

546
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
What is this?

547
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
The girl who is eating with her eyes closed.

548
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I heard the explanation of what it is.

549
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I thought I'd see it, but I haven't seen it yet.

550
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'll see it.

551
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Wow.

552
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Did you see this?

553
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
With Chaeyeon.

554
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I'm sure YUNJIN and ZEHA are watching this too.

555
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
We were at a local event and ZEHA was watching at this time.

556
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Right, we went to a university festival this week.

557
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It was so much fun.

558
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
The university students had so much fun playing with us.

559
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It was so much fun.

560
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
We went there as soon as the vacation ended.

561
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It felt like we were performing for the first time in a long time.

562
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
It was so much fun.

563
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
We also went to Busan and Daegu.

564
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Is it the first time for us to go to Busan?

565
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
We went to Busan once in the past.

566
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
This time, on the day we arrived in Busan,

567
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
we went to Busan.

568
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
It was early in the morning.

569
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
We went to eat grilled clams.

570
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:48,000
The next day, we woke up and had a burger soup.

571
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It was so good.

572
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I really like it.

573
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It was a burger soup.

574
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It was a burger soup.

575
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
We ate a burger sashimi there.

576
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
We also had a fried burger.

577
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I really like burgers.

578
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I was so happy to eat it after a long time.

579
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
After eating that,

580
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
we went to the beach.

581
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
The next day, we went to Daegu.

582
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
It was early in the morning.

583
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
We had to eat something delicious.

584
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
So, we had makjang.

585
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
It was the first time I had makjang at a restaurant.

586
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
It was the first time I had makjang at a restaurant.

587
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
It was really delicious.

588
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It was a bit serious.

589
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It was so delicious.

590
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Does it taste the same when you eat it in Daegu?

591
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Or does it taste the same when you eat it in Seoul?

592
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's because I really want to eat it.

593
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It was so delicious.

594
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I ate it in Daegu.

595
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Makjang is one of Daegu.

596
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Why?

597
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Makjang is for Daegu's people.

598
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Oh, I see.

599
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
It's a good restaurant, really.

600
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Our mission team

601
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
has someone who knows Daegu so well.

602
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Does it taste the same when you eat it in Seoul?

603
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Does it taste good already?

604
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Oh, so I have to go to Daegu.

605
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
If you want to eat it with that taste,

606
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
do you have to go to Daegu?

607
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I should go to Daegu right now.

608
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I should go to Daegu right now.

609
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
For real

610
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It was so good

611
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It was my first time eating makjang in a restaurant

612
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It was so crispy

613
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
It was so good

614
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
It was so good

615
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
After that

616
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
After the fan signing event

617
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I went to Busan

618
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
As soon as I arrived

619
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I ate clam noodles

620
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
No, kalguksu

621
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I ate clam kalguksu

622
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I ate a lot of delicious food

623
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And then

624
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Yesterday in Seoul

625
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I had pilates for the first time in a long time

626
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I almost died

627
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It was so hard

628
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Even walking hurts

629
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
My muscles hurt so much

630
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I want to eat kalguksu

631
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I want to eat kalguksu

632
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I like mung bean assert Isu

633
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I like mung bean assert Ayu

634
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I like mung bean assert Ayu

635
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I haven't seen the fireworks festival

636
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I saw it

637
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I went to the airport

638
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I went to the airport

639
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I saw it

640
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I didn't mail it. I took it. I'll do it soon.

641
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Oh, right. I went to see IU's concert.

642
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It was our first time.

643
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
We were guests this year.

644
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,000
We couldn't see each other because of the music show.

645
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
So we went.

646
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
It was so much fun.

647
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It was crazy.

648
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
They were so pretty.

649
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
They were so good.

650
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
It was like Disney.

651
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
All the directors.

652
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
They sang all the songs I knew.

653
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I went to say hello after the concert.

654
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I wore a hat.

655
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I wanted to say thank you to them.

656
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I met them in person.

657
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
So I said that.

658
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
They said,

659
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
That hat is still in my house.

660
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
It's so pretty.

661
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I'm keeping it well.

662
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I thought it was too much for me.

663
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I was so happy.

664
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I was so grateful.

665
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
They said that.

666
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Thank you.

667
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
That's why I have kirin on my bag.

668
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
This is...

669
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
But I lost this.

670
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I really love you.

671
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I went with my mom.

672
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
My mom and I...

673
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Not my mom, but when I was young,

674
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
we watched a lot of Korean dramas together.

675
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:12,000
My family really liked them, so I watched them with them.

676
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I really liked it.

677
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
It was so fun.

678
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It's been 35 minutes already.

679
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I'm hungry.

680
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I worked so hard on my lower body.

681
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
It really hurts.

682
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I really hate muscle pain.

683
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Do you have saliva these days?

684
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I don't have saliva these days.

685
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I don't have this.

686
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Do you want to come to a Japanese cultural festival?

687
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I want you to come to a Japanese cultural festival.

688
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
There aren't many cultures like that in Japan.

689
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
There's a talk show.

690
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I've never heard of an idol coming to a talk show.

691
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I wish I could.

692
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Is it difficult?

693
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Not really.

694
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I'm waiting for the day off.

695
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I haven't taken the day off yet.

696
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
When is it?

697
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I'm excited.

698
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
There's a place where we can meet.

699
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I want to go there. It looks fun.

700
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
When will the team log be released?

701
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
When?

702
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
That festival...

703
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I took a film while walking around the house.

704
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I didn't take full photos with one individual.

705
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I took video with other members.

706
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I don't know when that filming will be released.

707
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
It'll come out in theperformance format.

708
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
That film log is very great but...

709
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:17,400
Of course, I love it, but I used to film alone for a week or so.

710
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,100
One person at a time.

711
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,000
It was fun back then, too. I want to do that, too.

712
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,400
It's a real improvement.

713
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:34,100
I think it was a content where I could feel the day of this person.

714
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,500
So I want to say, I want to do it again.

715
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I think it would be good to do it at the end of the year.

716
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Because I went back and forth and went abroad a lot.

717
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,500
It was a content that Pimlog liked the most.

718
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,500
It was fun to wash up, too.

719
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,500
Shall we go now?

720
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,000
2 minutes left. Until 40 minutes.

721
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,340
is not today's bibliography late

722
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:21,100
It's who's wanna go to the Pimlog open-ended airport?

723
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,200
I didn't do it.

724
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,500
I'll do a lot.

725
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,800
Don't go.

726
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,600
I don't like it.

727
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I don't know when I'll be able to go to the concert, though.

728
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I'm filming UNIVERSE right now.

729
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I'm filming UNIVERSE right now.

730
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Because...

731
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I'm filming UNIVERSE right now.

732
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Because...

733
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Actually, UNIVERSE...

734
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Since before the crazy promotion...

735
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Since before the crazy promotion...

736
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
There are a lot of things that I filmed.

737
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And this time, UNIVERSE has a lot of new attempts.

And this time, UNIVERSE has a lot of new attempts.

739
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Wait.

740
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So...

741
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
So...

742
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Please look forward to it.

743
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Please look forward to it.

744
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I think it's going to be fun.

745
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I don't know how it's going to turn out.

746
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I don't know how it's going to turn out.

747
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So, it's been a while since I've done a Weverse rap.

748
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
So...

749
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I think it's going to be fun.

750
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I have returned to the V-Live after a long time.

751
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I will get closer.

752
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I will come again.

753
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I will come again.

754
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
It's 10 pm in the future, right?

755
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I have to go to bed early.

756
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Hello, FIORA.

757
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
FIORA, you should go to bed early too.

758
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Let's work hard tomorrow.

759
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
All the best!

760
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Good night.

761
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Thank you for watching.
