1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Wow, this is the last one.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's the last one.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I don't remember.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What is it?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's go.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's Kira.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Kira! Kira!

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm here.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today is a little...

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's a little...

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's a clear team.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's a clear team.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Unnie, what's this?

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Did you drink?

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's that kind of time.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What time is it?

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's...

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
45 minutes.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Why is it 45 minutes?

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's 12 o'clock.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's late at night.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's going to be the 28th.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
How has our day been?

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
How has our day been?

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
How was it today?

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm going to ask Eunchae this question.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So sad.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Why?

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Congratulations.

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Graduation congratulations.

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It was...

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Because today.

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Because...

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Graduation.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I graduated.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
From Music Bank.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh my god.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Everybody, applause.

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Applause.

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thank you.

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Thank you.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Well, today,

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
more people came in than usual.

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It was the last time.

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Really?

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Really.

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Why are you misunderstanding?

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm still...

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't want to be too sad.

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I want to have a happy, happy day today.

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I've been holding back my tears.

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I've been having a lot of fun.

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But Fearnot keeps crying.

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But I'm holding back my tears at the end of the speech.

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I know.

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Really?

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Because the writers in front of me

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
on the paper

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
They said they love you so much.

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
They said a lot of things.

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I thought I was going to cry, so I tried not to see it.

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I didn't see it until the end.

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So I didn't see what it said.

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I love you so much.

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I love you so much.

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I love you so much.

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Thank you.

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Thank you.

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Fearnot wrote something.

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I posted it.

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Don't forget.

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Eunchae, I love you so much.

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Of course I don't forget.

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I can't forget these times.

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I can't forget.

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll cherish it in my heart.

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
When we make a comeback,

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I think I'll be happy.

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm going to make a comeback soon.

81
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
When I watched it,

82
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Eunchae looked so happy.

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I think I'm having a lot of fun.

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I was so proud.

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I was so sincere.

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Eunchae's teenage years.

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That's right.

88
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's really amazing.

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's really Eunchae's style.

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
She wrote me a letter.

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I read one on my way here today.

92
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Writer

93
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Eunchae's precious teenage last

94
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Thank you for being with Music Bank for a long time.

95
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
There were these words.

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Thank you so much.

97
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
They're really good people.

98
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Really.

99
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I love you.

100
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I love you.

101
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Thank you so much.

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Everyone was sincere.

103
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Thank you so much.

104
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Starry, too.

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Starry is on my own.

106
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I was a guest today.

107
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I was alone.

108
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's so sad.

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I thought I was going to cry.

110
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Did you hold it in then?

111
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I held it in.

112
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I cried after I finished.

113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Starry cried after the music video.

114
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You cried after Starry.

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I cried then, too.

116
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We really didn't know they were coming.

117
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We really didn't know at all.

118
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We were really excited.

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We always had expectations.

120
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But we really didn't know.

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So

122
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We kept saying that we were sad

123
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
because there were no makeup artists.

124
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But we knew they were coming.

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So we were like,

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
it's going to be hard for Eunji.

127
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
No, today

128
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
we told them to do well

129
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
at the end.

130
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But they couldn't go

131
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
because they had to prepare for the festival.

132
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So the teachers couldn't go with them.

133
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The teachers who were always with us

134
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
couldn't go with me.

135
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So we were like,

136
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
it's really sad.

137
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But we were really surprised.

138
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Really.

139
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It was fast, but we couldn't go.

140
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It was a huge success.

141
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Because we couldn't go

142
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
in the first class.

143
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I forgot about it in the first class.

144
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I forgot about it in the first class.

145
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We had dinner.

146
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Wow, seriously

147
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
your bangs...

148
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You're so short.

149
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's commanding one step forward.

150
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That's recommended?

151
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That's cool.

152
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I think we'll have to put that part

153
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
in our local...

154
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I think what's coming up

155
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
will be...

156
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's the same.

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It was really cute.

158
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's been a year and seven months, but it's so different.

159
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I was surprised too.

160
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The writers took my waiting room like the X-Rom of Hwanseungnyeon.

161
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Like X-Rom.

162
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
They took all my pictures and put them on the wall.

163
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:59,000
In 2023 and 2024, they compared similar pink clothes and put them on the wall.

164
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's really different.

165
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's really big.

166
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You look like Eun Ji-won.

167
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's really big.

168
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Is the speed too fast?

169
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's pretty big.

170
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Time is fast.

171
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Isn't the height still growing?

172
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's grown a lot since then.

173
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And I prepared for the building today.

174
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But the teachers couldn't go with me.

175
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So I ordered a cake while I was in the bathroom.

176
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Really?

177
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
They ordered a cake for me.

178
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And I had a ribbon on my head when I was in WORLD.

179
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I had a cake with the ribbon on my head.

180
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I was so surprised.

181
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I was really surprised.

182
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I got a cake to congratulate my graduation.

183
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It was the best.

184
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So on my way to work today,

185
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I listened to WORLD's 7MEN's songs.

186
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's a song of memories.

187
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes, it's a song of memories.

188
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You did a great job.

189
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You did a great job.

190
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Thank you so much.

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You did a great job.

192
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
If you're watching this at home,

193
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
please give her a round of applause.

194
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You did a great job.

195
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You did a great job.

196
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
After finishing the music video,

197
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
we went to the university festival.

198
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's right.

199
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It was really fun.

200
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It was really fun.

201
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
How was it?

202
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I think it's been a year and a half since we went there.

203
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I think it's been a year and a half.

204
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
There were much more songs than then.

205
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I think there were much more songs than then.

206
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
There were more famous songs.

207
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That's right.

208
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That was so cool.

209
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
All the students sang along.

210
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
All the students sang along.

211
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The energy.

212
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
College festival is a college festival.

213
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It was so fun.

214
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The weather was perfect.

215
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh, today's Gwagidae festival was so much fun.

216
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Really? Thank you.

217
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Today's Gwagidae festival was the best.

218
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It was fun today, too.

219
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's been a long time since we've done an anti.

220
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's been a long time.

221
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We did it during the tour, but we didn't do it during the fan meeting.

222
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's definitely a representative song.

223
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
There was Gwagidae.

224
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Thank you.

225
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
There were a lot of people.

226
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Gwagidae has a lot of people.

227
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
There were a lot of people.

228
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And overseas.

229
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Are they foreign students?

230
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
There are a lot of foreign students.

231
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I was surprised.

232
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
They sang all the songs.

233
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That's right.

234
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
They sang it for us.

235
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The first person to come from Seogangdae.

236
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I heard that they waited from 6 a.m. today.

237
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I was so surprised.

238
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Thank you.

239
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let's go next week.

240
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Right.

241
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
There are a lot of festivals planned.

242
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
There are a lot.

243
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Seven.

244
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Seven?

245
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Seven?

246
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We'll go meet a lot of foreign students.

247
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's our first time to visit a house in Korea.

248
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's our first time.

249
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We're doing a fan signing event.

250
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That's right.

251
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm looking forward to it.

252
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I've never been to a fan signing event.

253
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's finally fun.

254
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I think it's going to be fun.

255
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Everyone, don't get sick until that day.

256
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Please wait for us.

257
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Please wait for us.

258
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'll take care of my health.

259
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I promise not to get hurt while enjoying the festival.

260
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That's right.

261
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Keep it real.

262
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Members, too.

263
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's right.

264
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Stay healthy every day.

265
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Let's have fun memories.

266
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yes.

267
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Fun memories.

268
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It was so much fun.

269
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's too late.

270
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Good night.

271
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Good night.

272
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I woke up.

273
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's 54.

274
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's 54.

275
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's too late.

276
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's too late.

277
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's too late.

278
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's too late.

279
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's too late.

280
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's too late.

281
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's too late.

282
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's too late.

283
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's too late.

284
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's too late.

285
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It won't happen again, right?

286
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Finally, Eunchae.

287
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Well done.

288
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You did a good job.

289
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Thank you.

290
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You worked so hard.

291
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You worked so hard.

292
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Wow.

293
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Thank you.

294
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Thank you so much.

295
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What?

296
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'll give you a box of these.

297
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
How did you get so many colleagues?

298
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It rained, too.

299
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You worked hard today.

300
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Thank you.

301
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Rain, too.

302
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Thank you.

303
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Really.

304
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Let's go.

305
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The sleep was good.

306
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Good night.

307
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Good night.

308
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Good night.
