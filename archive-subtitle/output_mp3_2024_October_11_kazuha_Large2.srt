1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,920
Who do they like & who are they worried about?

2
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:18,764


3
00:00:21,725 --> 00:00:22,963


4
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:24,564


5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,880
Hi

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,880
Hello

7
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,720
Hello

8
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,760
Everyone gather, gather, gather

9
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,580
You didn't expect it, right?

10
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,500
I didn't expect it either

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,960
We just came back from doing the choreography

12
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,960
So it's a little bit like that

13
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,960
All of a sudden?

14
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,960
All of a sudden

15
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,960
All of a sudden, it's okay, right?

16
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:29,843


17
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:32,083
Because it's going out

18
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,880
That's right, that's right, I practiced

19
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:38,214
What are you doing right now?

20
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,880
It's Friday afternoon

21
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,880
Hello

22
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,880
Hi

23
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,880
Thank you for your hard work

24
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,880
Wait a minute

25
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,584


26
00:02:11,142 --> 00:02:12,101
It's time

27
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,880
I wanted to play with Fiona, so I put it on after a long time

28
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,880
What is it? Why is it so black here?

29
00:02:15,376 --> 00:02:18,591


30
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,880
How are you? I'm good

31
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,114
How are you, Fiona?

32
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,880
Hi

33
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,880
Are you all busy right now?

34
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:38,617
Are you going home after work?

35
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,880
There must be a lot of people

36
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:41,946
Or are you still working?

37
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,880
Every day

38
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,880
Just living is really amazing

39
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,880
Um

40
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,880
Oh, I'm studying, but I came to see you

41
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,880
I came to see you

42
00:03:08,414 --> 00:03:10,374
I'm going to study

43
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,880
Oh right

44
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,880
Next month

45
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,880
I'm going back to Osaka

46
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,880
Oh, it's getting a little cold in Japan

47
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,880
In Korea too

48
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,880
Recently

49
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,880
It feels a little cold

50
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,880
Then the bangs

51
00:03:36,777 --> 00:03:41,302
This is the bangs

52
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,880
Now

53
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,880
Here

54
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,880
The bangs

55
00:03:45,297 --> 00:03:47,105
Welcome

56
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,746


57
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:09,651
I

58
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,325
No banks

59
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,880
Oh

60
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,880
Yes

61
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:26,519


62
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,880
I cabeça

63
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:38,162
Originally, I wanted to go to Italy or somewhere like that.

64
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,880
At first, I wanted to go.

65
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:45,979
I wanted to go to a country that I had never been to before.

66
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,880
I thought about it.

67
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:56,880
I wanted to go to Paris for my first vacation.

68
00:05:00,582 --> 00:05:01,795


69
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,880
When I was studying abroad,

70
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:20,212


71
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:23,212


72
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,880
Before the quarantine started,

73
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,880
I had a vacation at a ballet school.

74
00:05:27,005 --> 00:05:28,475
At that time, my mom and dad came to the Netherlands.

75
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,880
So I was there for about a week.

76
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:45,880
I took a train with my parents and went to Paris for the first time.

77
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,880
I have a really good memory of that time.

78
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,880
I have a really good memory of that time.

79
00:05:48,952 --> 00:05:50,739
I wanted to go there again.

80
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,880
I had to eat lunch.

81
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,880
Two years? Three years?

82
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,880
What was it?

83
00:06:20,772 --> 00:06:21,778


84
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:26,183


85
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,408


86
00:06:28,695 --> 00:06:30,047


87
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,880
The name is,

88
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,880
a kind of food named Cascade?

89
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,880
In three years, I'm going to go again.

90
00:06:47,394 --> 00:06:50,258
It's been 3 years since I went back to Paris.

91
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:56,560
I went to Paris for the first time with my mom and dad as a foreign student.

92
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,960
We had dinner together.

93
00:07:04,138 --> 00:07:08,617
I'm eating the same food in the same restaurant with my mom.

94
00:07:08,869 --> 00:07:10,971
I felt very strange.

95
00:07:11,596 --> 00:07:17,546
I think it's a very meaningful restaurant for me.

96
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,538


97
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,640
When will LUNAVERSE come out?

98
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,640
LUNAVERSE?

99
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,640
LUNAVERSE...

100
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,640
You can look forward to it.

101
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,640
LUNAVERSE is really...

102
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,640
It's really...

103
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,640
It's amazing.

104
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,640
It's really...

105
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,640
I think LUNAVERSE knows loyalty more than loyalty.

106
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,640
LUNAVERSE staff.

107
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,640
Thank you so much.

108
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,640
Thank you and I love you.

109
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,640
There's going to be a lot of fun content.

110
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,640
It's always been like that.

111
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,640
It's always been like that.

112
00:08:00,371 --> 00:08:01,708
More...

113
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,640
In a variety of ways.

114
00:08:01,776 --> 00:08:05,436
More new...

115
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,640
I think I'll be able to see loyalty.

116
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,057


117
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,640
Today's fashion show is totally comfort.

118
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,640
The theme is comfort.

119
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,660


120
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,640
That's right.

121
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,640
I said that, and it suddenly came out.

122
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,640
Marion's more embarrassed.

123
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,640
So, I was surprised, too.

124
00:08:48,557 --> 00:08:49,556
It came out well when I took it upright.

125
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,640
It's really funny.

126
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,640
I didn't even imagine it then.

127
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,640
I didn't know I'd take the shoe thief.

128
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,640
I became a real thief.

129
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
Jaewon.

130
00:09:19,063 --> 00:09:21,550
The other members are on their separate schedules.

131
00:09:21,948 --> 00:09:23,441


132
00:09:25,343 --> 00:09:27,219
We've been together until now.

133
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,640
Spoiler? What spoiler?

134
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
I really like spoilers.

135
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,640
What kind of spoiler?

136
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,640
The lighting.

137
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,640
It's working.

138
00:09:55,984 --> 00:09:58,192
Another episode.

139
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,640
We took a TikTok together.

140
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,640
Please wait a moment.

141
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,246
Is the monitor the lighting?

142
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,246
Yes, it is.

143
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
The monitor.

144
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,640
My PC.

145
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,640
The white background is my lighting.

146
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,640
It's a white background.

147
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,640
Like this.

148
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,640
The blue background.

149
00:10:29,101 --> 00:10:30,395
The blue background is fine.

150
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,640
No, the white background.

151
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,640
It's too white.

152
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,640
The white background is too white.

153
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,640
The blue background is fine.

154
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,640
Kaza, your eyes are so shiny.

155
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,640
Really?

156
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,640
Really?

157
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,640
So the shot is considerate like this.

158
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:21,440


159
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,640
Really?

160
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:37,640
As expected, I want to eat something warm because it's getting a little chilly.

161
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,640
Recommend me ice cream. Ice cream.

162
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,640
The one at the convenience store.

163
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:56,028


164
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:05,640
Dubai chocolate ice cream.

165
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,640
It's sold these days.

166
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,640
Yoonjin told me about it.

167
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,640
It was good.

168
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,640
I don't know what Dubai chocolate is.

169
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:24,640
My teacher bought it for me and I ate it.

170
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,640
It was really good.

171
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,640
Dubai chocolate.

172
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,640
Is it popular in Japan?

173
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,640
Is it popular all over the world?

174
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,640
I don't know.

175
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,640
I really want to eat chestnut tiramisu.

176
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,640
What should I do?

177
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,640
Chestnut tiramisu.

178
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,640
I think it will be really good.

179
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,640
I really respect it.

180
00:13:17,742 --> 00:13:19,195
Dubai chocolate is popular.

181
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:21,137


182
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:36,640
Um.

183
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,640
Can you do an impersonation of your sister?

184
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,976
Whose impersonation is it?

185
00:14:00,044 --> 00:14:01,572


186
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,640
Short hair? I want to try it once.

187
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:20,714
I want to try it once.

188
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,640
But if I do it, it's a little...

189
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,640
How should I say it?

190
00:14:26,404 --> 00:14:28,217
It's a little embarrassing.

191
00:14:30,534 --> 00:14:31,560
No.

192
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,640
I think it's going to be a little embarrassing.

193
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:35,994


194
00:14:36,062 --> 00:14:37,689


195
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,640
It's not like that.

196
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,640
I think it's going to change my image.

197
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,640
That's how it is.

198
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Honey, it's not short hair.

199
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,640
It's not short hair.

200
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,640
You're so sure.

201
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
That's good.

202
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
Honesty.

203
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,723


204
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,034
It's over there?

205
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,640
Yeah.

206
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,640
Ah.

207
00:15:25,578 --> 00:15:27,571


208
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
It's done.

209
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,820
How tall are you?

210
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,260
I haven't tried it lately.

211
00:15:53,860 --> 00:16:03,000
When I first debuted, I was 74cm tall, so I was surprised.

212
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:14,864
Is it there or not?

213
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,180
What should I say?

214
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,860
I don't know if it's there or not.

215
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,540
It's hard to say in Korean.

216
00:16:27,626 --> 00:16:29,560


217
00:16:38,881 --> 00:16:40,201
Is it there or not?

218
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,248


219
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,220
Am I taller than Eunchae?

220
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,240
Uh, but, I don't know.

221
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,240
Isn't it similar?

222
00:17:25,103 --> 00:17:27,656
Be careful of the bread. Why are you being careful?

223
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,160
I'll be on MINA's LIVE next time, and I'll be asking you to compare my height in front of the fans.

224
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,860
Show... Show...

225
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,260
Comparison.

226
00:17:39,398 --> 00:17:41,486


227
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,760
I'll do that.

228
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:58,619


229
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:01,793


230
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:47,460
It's really not easy to work out.

231
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:58,460
I worked out thinking about soy sauce marinated crab today.

232
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:07,460
I think I'm going to eat with the members later.

233
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:14,460
I worked out thinking about soy sauce marinated crab.

234
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,460
Hamstring.

235
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,460
Hamstring.

236
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,460
You know, the thing you do like this.

237
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,460
The machine that you bend in the back.

238
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,460
I did that.

239
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,460
Soy sauce marinated crab.

240
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,460
Soy sauce marinated crab.

241
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,460
I was doing it, and it gave me strength.

242
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,460
As expected, the power of appetite.

243
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,460
I recommend you to do this.

244
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,460
Think about what you want to eat and exercise.

245
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:25,641
But I think I'm a bit tanned these days.

246
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,980
Sometimes I look tanned.

247
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,040
I told YUNJIN that.

248
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,620
I said, I think I'm tanned these days.

249
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,880
YUNJIN said, ZUHA, do you know this?

250
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,488
I think I'm tanned.

251
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:55,339
But T says I don't think I'm tanned at all.

252
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:55,339


253
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,600
So you're tanned.

254
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:00,980
That's what she said.

255
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,880
Oh, I see. Then I'm tanned.

256
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,220
I guess I'm tanned.

257
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,820
I guess I'm tanned from the thought of it.

258
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:22,665


259
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:24,734


260
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,960
Should I doâ?

261
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,940
You have to have a Доji.

262
00:21:28,936 --> 00:21:29,936


263
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,680
I...

264
00:21:33,912 --> 00:21:34,846


265
00:21:35,225 --> 00:21:37,269


266
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,920
from Busan, from Daegu.

267
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:53,460
I ate makjang and daechang and it was so good

268
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:59,460
I used to like daechang a lot

269
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,460
Not daechang, makjang and...

270
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,460
What's makjang and?

271
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,460
Makjang and...

272
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,460
Not makjang and...

273
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,460
Makjang and...

274
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,460
What's makjang and?

275
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,460
Let me know

276
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,460
Makjang...

277
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,460
Right, right, there's makjang-gori in Daegu

278
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,460
Gopchang, makjang, daechang

279
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,460
Right, I ate gopchang and makjang

280
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,460
It was really good

281
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,460
It was better at the restaurant

282
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:55,460
I'll recommend Gopchang to Fiona today

283
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,460
Chipotle

284
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,209
I saw chipotle in Paris

285
00:23:12,277 --> 00:23:13,853
So...

286
00:23:14,534 --> 00:23:15,822
I was going to go

287
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,460
I wanted to go but I didn't

288
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,460
I wanted to introduce it to my mom

289
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,460
I wanted to introduce it to her

290
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,460
Did you enjoy Zimline?

291
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:39,493
Shh

292
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,460
It's still a secret

293
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,460
We know everything

294
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,460
Right, Fiona knows everything

295
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,884
Really

296
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,460
I still remember Zimline

297
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,460
That's sooo cute

298
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,460
What?

299
00:24:39,264 --> 00:24:40,785


300
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,460
Did you know that?

301
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,460
You can make a heart

302
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,460
ribbon heart

303
00:24:50,003 --> 00:24:52,203
The person who thought of the ribbon heart is amazing.

304
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:58,645
What?

305
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,460
"It's just a pose even if you stay still."

306
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,460
You're cool.

307
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,460
cheek fat

308
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,460
Congratulations on your birthday.

309
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,460
"Where's all the cheek fat?"

310
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,460
Where did it go?

311
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,460
Yes.

312
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,460
I wanted to hang out with you for a while.

313
00:25:39,564 --> 00:25:41,501


314
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,460
I wanted to hang out with you for a while.

315
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,460
It's already been 25 minutes.

316
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,460
It's really fast.

317
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,460
It's really fast.

318
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,460
Something's coming out at 5 o'clock.

319
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,460
I don't think it's a big deal.

320
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,878


321
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,460
I'll go now.

322
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,460
Is it enough?

323
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,460
I'm sure there's something big enough.

324
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,460
I'm looking forward to seeing you again.

325
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,460
See you again.

326
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,094


327
00:26:38,209 --> 00:26:39,910
Have a good dinner.

328
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:43,110
Bye, I'll have something delicious.

329
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,460
Bye-bye.

330
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:52,100


331
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,460
See you again.
