00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
Hello, this is Ahsin.

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,860
Guys

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,240
please be understanding

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,120
I made this video for songchu

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,720
I will watch the video

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:33,720
I really like the song BODYS more than SOFT SPOT.

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:43,720
I'm going crazy.

8
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:53,720
I'm going crazy.

9
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,720
I'm going crazy.

10
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,720
I'm so sorry.

11
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,720
I messed up the melody for that.

12
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,720
This is Keshi.

13
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,720
I'm so sorry.

14
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,720
Is that Keshi?

15
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,720
It's Riri.

16
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,100
Put it in theuras that I shared with you and try it when you go out.

17
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,140
16 garlic ilurs

18
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,980
Let's also taste it.

19
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,320
It was better than I thought a lot of noodles.

20
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,820
Does the visual come off as hard?

21
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,140
If you hide to someone

22
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,140
Go and change their mind

23
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:43,140
It's all out today, you know

24
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,140
If it's a long waste of time

25
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,140
It's a use to have it all

26
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,140
I have a lot of glasses.

27
00:02:53,140 --> 00:03:00,140
I only bought glasses from Axel.

28
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,140
This feels a little cool.

29
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,140
This is what I've been using at SIS.

30
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,140
This is a real glasses.

31
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,140
There's a number of them, so my eyes are a little smaller.

32
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,140
Oh, look at the dirt.

33
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,140
It's been a while since I've used it.

34
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:49,140
Wow

35
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,140
I need to organize my glasses.

36
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:56,140
Among these, I still have the most

37
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,140
I'm going to organize my glasses.

38
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,140
I'm going to organize my glasses.

39
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,140
The best

40
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:11,140
The best glasses for this look right now.

41
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:19,140
First of all, the song is so good.

42
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,140
I think I need to put it in the oven.

43
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,140
180 degrees for 30 minutes

44
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,140
What I think is the most important thing is

45
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:33,140
Cooking

46
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:38,140
We're going to be tight.

47
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,140
I don't think Roon's hand is I'm going to bring it to you.

48
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,140
We were able to say that Re-mon

49
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,140
No, bear too big

50
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:53,140
This is really good.

51
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,140
Well, today ofRY

52
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,140
Since I made a pretty makeup,

53
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,140
I'm going to do it on my own

54
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,520
I really like that song too

55
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,140
I really like that song too

56
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,140
I really like that song too

57
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,140
I really like that song too

58
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,140
I really like that song too

59
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,140
The song is so good

60
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,140
The song is so good

61
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,280
It's so good

62
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,480
Isn't it so good?

63
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:33,140
What other songs do you think there will be?

64
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,140
Ah!

65
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,140
Wait a minute

66
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,140
Try writing it

67
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,140
It's so funny

68
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,140
This is

69
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,140
I'll show you the guitar

70
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,140
I'll show you the guitar

71
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,140
I got it

72
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,140
This is

73
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,140
I can get this

74
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,140
Great

75
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,140
Great

76
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:34,140
It's a deep-frozen expression.

77
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,140
Do you know this song, everyone?

78
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:10,140
It's like I'm company.

79
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:18,140
I can't lose my feet.

80
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:26,140
He's saying he's gonna win.

81
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,140
Let's get to the pytorch pointâ€¦

82
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,140
Okay, my guitar is still out of tune, though.

83
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,140
I love this song.

84
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,140
I love ceilings.

85
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:15,140
Okay, I'm still practicing, so I don't think I can show you like a full cover, but,

86
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:19,140
Guys, are you curious about the jellyfish song?

87
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,140
Let's see.

88
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:55,140
Okay.

89
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,140
Should I show you the track first?

90
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,140
Let's see.

91
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,140
Let's see.

92
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,140
Let's see.

93
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,140
And there's another story about jellyfish.

94
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:44,140
No, yesterday, I gave Eunchae something to give him.

95
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,140
So I went to find Eunchae.

96
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:53,140
So I was going to give something to Eunchae and come back down.

97
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:58,140
Suddenly, Eunchae opened this.

98
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:14,140
Eunchae said he had a hard time with BMA.

99
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,140
So I bought this for him.

100
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,140
I gave him this.

101
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,140
No, that's why it's so...

102
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,140
I gave him this.

103
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,140
Isn't it so cute?

104
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,140
Isn't it so cute?

105
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,140
But this isn't the end.

106
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,140
You said you still have something to give him.

107
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,140
It's so touching.

108
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,140
I'm going to put it in my bag again.

109
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,140
I was so touched.

110
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,140
Okay.

111
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:08,140
Then, I have something to do tomorrow.

112
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,140
Look at the time.

113
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,140
It's already 12 o'clock.

114
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,140
Yes.

115
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,140
I'll go.

116
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,140
I'll listen to a song for the last time.

117
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,140
And then I'll go.

118
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,140
Oh, Chae Won's mood light.

119
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,140
What happened?

120
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,140
I saw it.

121
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,140
And then...

122
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:50,140
That...

123
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,140
Battery?

124
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,140
What are we talking about in Korean?

125
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,140
I can't fingertips.

126
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,140
I still haven't installed it.

127
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,140
are you going to put that up again when you do that, too?

128
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,140
No, when I get it, it's really...

129
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,140
No, I have been moving too much.

130
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,760
That's the only thing that came to my mind.

131
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,680
How can you give me such a sensible gift?

132
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,680
It's the same for Eun Chae.

133
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,680
I mean, that's what I like.

134
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,680
Oh, it's obvious.

135
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,680
It's obvious.

136
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,680
I'm a bit of a transparent person.

137
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,680
But I thought about giving it to you.

138
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,680
I'm so touched.

139
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,680
Really.

140
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,680
It's really my type.

141
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
Aha, okay.

142
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:01,680
Then let's end it with this.

143
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,680
It was a good song, right?

144
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,680
It was a good song.

145
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,680
It was a good song.

146
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,680
It was a good song.

147
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,680
It was a good song.

148
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,680
It was a good song.

149
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,680
It was a good song.

150
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,680
It was a good song.

151
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,680
It was a good song.

152
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,680
It was a good song.

153
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,680
It was a good song.

154
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,680
It was a good song.

155
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,680
It was a good song.

156
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,680
It was a good song.

157
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,680
It was a good song.

158
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,680
It was a good song.

159
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,680
It was a good song.

160
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,680
It was a good song.

161
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,680
It was a good song.

162
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,680
Is it a song by MCR?

163
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,680
I love it.

164
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,680
Libra season is here.

165
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
Oh my God.

166
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,680
I didn't make a congratulatory post about Libra season.

167
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,680
I'm going to have to do that in honor of Libra season

168
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,680
Taemo

169
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,680
And then

170
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,680
This song is about

171
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,680
Yoo Jae Ah sunbaenim's

172
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,680
I'll cover you

173
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,680
Yoo Jae Ah sunbaenim

174
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,680
Yoo Jae Ah sunbaenim

175
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,680
Yoon Jin Ah, when your parents listen to that song

176
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,680
I'll remember when I was young

177
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,680
I'll remember when I was young

178
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,680
I'll remember when I was young

179
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,680
Should I turn off the lights?

180
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,680
It's too dark

181
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,680
I'll turn off the light

182
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,680
It's time to put the peace to rest

183
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
With this

184
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,680
Should I go to bed?

185
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,680
Jenna girl behind you

186
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,680
Who is it?

187
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
Hank?

188
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,680
Isn't it time to sleep? Is it raining?

189
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,680
Is this the sound?

190
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,680
I feel like this is the best

191
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,680
After cars

192
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,680
Weren't you lonely

193
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,680
When you embraced me

194
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,680
Dear, are it memories of Dec trouver

195
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,680
To be given to me

196
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,680
Is it okay to find

197
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,480
Yeah, I'm a fan of V.

198
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,480
switches on

199
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,480
The Ju-en working while pretending to sleep

200
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,760
ihre

201
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,900
Winter's Ghana

202
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,920
She can't even see a stream

203
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,120
We are so different

204
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,120
win-win

205
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,160
I can't

206
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,560
I can't

207
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,560
Go

208
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,560
We are come, you are come

209
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:12,560
The sunset is blooming flowers

210
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:20,560
Our hearts that are different from each other

211
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:25,560
I'm trying to make it one

212
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:31,560
Because it's beautiful

213
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:40,560
The sun that started the day

214
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:46,560
The sounds of the rain on the ground

215
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:53,560
Tell me to be a light

216
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:58,560
Following the sun

217
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,560
My heart is filled with

218
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,560
My heart is filled with

219
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,560
My heart is filled with love

220
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:15,560
Let's go back to where we were

221
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,560
Happy birthday!

222
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,560
Today is your birthday?

223
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,560
I like all five of you

224
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,560
I agree!

225
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:37,560
You look good on me

226
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,560
Thank you

227
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:52,560
Happy birthday!

228
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,560
HyunA why

229
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,560
Aren't you going to sleep?

230
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,560
The world is brighter after meeting YunJin?

231
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,560
The color got brighter?

232
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,560
No way, it's the same for me

233
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,560
No way, it's the same for me

234
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,560
How is it?

235
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,560
No way, it's the same for me

236
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,560
I really like this song

237
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,560
No way, it's the same for me

238
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,560
No way, it's the same for me

239
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,560
Until you disappeared

240
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:34,560
I couldn't even move my steps

241
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:40,560
What kind of person I was

242
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:46,560
What kind of pain I had

243
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:52,560
Now I regret it

244
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,560
After I turned around

245
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:02,560
I regret it again

246
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:08,560
Because of someone else

247
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,560
I was faltering

248
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,560
But you protected me

249
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:26,560
I didn't know why love came

250
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:32,560
I just opened my ears and cried

251
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:40,560
My tears flowed to my heart

252
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,560
You hurt me

253
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,560
I pushed you away

254
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:52,560
Why did love leave

255
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,560
It's turned off?

256
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,560
I'm going crazy

257
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,560
Hey, I shouldn't sing

258
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,560
Ah, I'm going crazy

259
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,560
Really?

260
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,560
Ah, I'm going crazy

261
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,560
Really?

262
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,560
Then, before the last song

263
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,560
I'll sing a song

264
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,560
Now, the last song.

265
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,560
I'm going to do one more encore song after the last song.

266
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,560
This is a song I really, really, really cherish.

267
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,560
It's a song that I really, really, really love.

268
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,560
With the love of Wave to Earth.

269
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,560
Please listen to it.

270
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
And fill the my poems and earphones.

271
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,560
Here's the standard wrong way.

272
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
Please listen to the lyrics.

273
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,560
Listen...

274
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,560
Listen...

275
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,560
Listen...

276
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,560
Listen...

277
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,560
Listen...

278
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
Listen...

279
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,560
Listen...

280
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:32,100
If I put it down

281
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,560
Love will end

282
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:42,460
Is worth future

283
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,500
It's so good

284
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:04,560
This ring is so pretty.

285
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:13,560
If you're watching this, I love you.

286
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:36,560
Now, the last song.

287
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,560
Jihyo.

288
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,560

Jihyo.

344
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:02,560
It's blue because you're in love

345
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,560
I don't know what to do with you anymore

346
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:18,560
I don't want to let you go in front of me

347
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,560
To the end of that young dream

348
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,560
And I know it's not the same

349
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,560
Everything changed

350
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,560
It's like I'm trapped in a maze

351
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,560
I'm still looking for something

352
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,560
Don't you feel we all love something

353
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,560
It's a dream, a dream, a room full of scent

354
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,560
I want to open it to everyone

355
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,560
Play with me the more it hurts

356
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:54,560
Will you tell me something precious?

357
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,560
I'm crazy

358
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,560
I'm crazy for you

359
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,560
Feeling more

360
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,560
I can go crazy

361
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,560
It's blue because you're in love

362
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,560
What's crazier

363
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,560
Than loving more

364
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,560
I can't go crazy

365
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,560
Still beautiful

366
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:34,560
If I love you like crazy

367
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,560
Someday I'll look back and see

368
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,560
A flower blooming on a thornbush

369
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:01,560
I love you

370
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:07,560
I think I did it for a really long time

371
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,560
About an hour and a half?

372
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:19,560
I'll put you to sleep tomorrow morning

373
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,560
I hope you sleep well

374
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:29,560
I'll clean up my room, remove my makeup, and wash up

375
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,560
I'll go to bed now

376
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,560
I love you

377
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,560
Bye
