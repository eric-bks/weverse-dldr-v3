00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hi

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's Minjun

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's going well, right?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What's up

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm in my room

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's not a perm

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I have a shoot today

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I have a shoot

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I took off my hair

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I took off my hair

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
A perm?

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I had my hair curled

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's right, I had a shoot today

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What's up

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Where are you this late?

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm at home

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm at the dorm

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Do you have time?

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yes, I have time

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Time is

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Like this

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I always come when I have time

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What shoot do I have today?

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Today

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I washed my hair

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
To my house

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm coming

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Did you do your hair?

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
How do you feel?

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,960
Everybody

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,340
Ye turtle

33
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,720
You have asta hair

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's good

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yes

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Fantastic

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Do I play any games? I unfortunately don't play any games.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Can you introduce me to one of the books in the back?

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Okay.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hold on a second.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Let me see.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Hmm.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah.

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Hmm.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Hmm.

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What's up?

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh, what did I think of the UK?

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It was so great. I had such a good time.

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh, yeah.

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay.

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay.

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The Book Thief.

55
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I've talked about this book a lot, but

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I think it's actually

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
like a modern

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
book that will become

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
a classic,

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I think.

61
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's very, very good.

62
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It talks about...

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Oh, my gosh.

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Oh, there's so much

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
mungy.

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah.

67
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's about

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
the power of

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:42,000
like reading and books and imagination in really harrowing times because it's, you know,

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
based off of a real historical event.

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
How many books are in that book tower?

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I don't know.

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I don't know.

74
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's six movies.

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Thank you.

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,840
You know,

77
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
I think so.

78
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:56,940
It's cool.

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's cool.

80
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's cool.

81
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's cool.

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This.

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Queen of the Ice,

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and it's,

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I don't know.

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:31,000
There's a lot of like generational stuff which is something that feels really familiar to me.

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Like immigrants.

88
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Buy a bookshelf? I do have a bookshelf but that's already stacked.

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What's the most recent Japanese word you remember?

90
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What's the most recent Japanese word I remember?

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Giri giri

92
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But what if I fall over?

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't fall over.

94
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Because it's a steel bookshelf.

95
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's not just like this.

96
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's vertical.

97
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
How do you say it?

98
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's like lying down.

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Hair? I didn't dye my hair but

100
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Fiona kept telling me that I dyed my hair.

101
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I think I get a lot of light.

102
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I didn't dye my hair.

103
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I think it's the same blue.

104
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's the same blue but if it's dark it looks like black.

105
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Itv

106
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Sweden.

107
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Switzerland was so beautiful

108
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
We were really

109
00:08:48,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Since I became a trainee, for the first time in a long time, I spent time with my family, and it was really, really, really, really good.

110
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It was so good.

111
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What do you drink? I drink Yonana.

112
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But I shouldn't drink coffee at this time, but I drank it because I love A.

113
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But I still sleep well. Don't worry.

114
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But don't drink coffee at a late time, especially when you're young.

115
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Do you understand? Drink decaffeinated coffee.

116
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's a little hard to order again.

117
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Do you sleep well?

118
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Do I sleep well? I think I sleep fairly well.

119
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Do you miss Rachel?

120
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Do I miss Rachel? Yes, I miss Rachel so much.

121
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What is my coffee order?

122
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Just an iced Americano. Black. I like black coffee.

123
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What country do you want to go to after Switzerland?

124
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
There are so many countries I want to go to, so I think I need to write a bucket list.

125
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
There are so many. Anywhere. Any new country.

126
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Any new city. Anywhere. I love everything.

127
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
London was really good too.

128
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Fish and chips are good.

129
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And a lot of curry as well. I love curry.

130
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I love curry so much.

131
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Can you do a heart?

132
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh, so comfortable. Thank you.

133
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Because you are here while I'm eating. I love you.

134
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Aww.

135
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yeah, everybody, I hope you can get a good snack while you watch.

136
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Favorite topping on pizza? Broccoli and ricotta cheese.

137
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Or...

138
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't know. I like, I like me a white pizza with broccoli.

139
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Or, like, greens and, um, I don't know, cheese. Like, ricotta cheese.

140
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And also, I just like a margarita. Like, basil, basil leaves. That's really good too.

141
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Have you read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo?

142
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I have not, but Rachel is obsessed with that book. She, it's her favorite book.

143
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So, hopefully one day I will.

144
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Broccoli? Y'all are hating on broccoli?

145
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Ricotta does go crazy on pizza.

146
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It goes what?

147
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Can I eat the jjapaghetti on Yunjin's head?

148
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's blue. Would you be okay with that?

149
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I don't have it.

150
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Ribbons.

151
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's dessert.

152
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,820
I wish it would

153
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,000
Chopsticks.

154
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The Però the Dragon Tattoo is good?

155
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
My mom used to have that book back at home.

156
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
How does it feel to perform at a festival after a long time?

157
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It was really really really fun.

158
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Really...

159
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I kept talking to the members and they said it was really fun.

160
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It was really really fun.

161
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It was really fun and...

162
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Really...

163
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The energy and the heat

164
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
were no joke.

165
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Really...

166
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
For me, when I watch a performance

167
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
or when I perform,

168
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
everyone in that space feels liberated

169
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and really...

170
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
become one mind, one body

171
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
and really...

172
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
just...

173
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Forget about that moment and just enjoy everything.

174
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
That's how I feel.

175
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's like...

176
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Everyone enjoyed it so much

177
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
so it was really...

178
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
good and if we could give

179
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
a little bit of good energy,

180
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I don't think there's anything better than that.

181
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Really really...

182
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm looking forward to it in the future

183
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and I'll do my best.

184
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Ah! I'll look forward to the Hoseo Festival!

185
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'll look forward to it!

186
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'll definitely...

187
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
go and see it!

188
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
The college entrance exam!

189
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
There's 47 days left, nuna.

190
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Fighting!

191
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Fighting fighting! Fighting!

192
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Fighting for the college entrance exam!

193
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I also...

194
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I also...

195
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The US...

196
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
college entrance exam?

197
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
A few years ago...

198
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I really...

199
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
prepared for it.

200
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But it was really...

201
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
really hard.

202
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Studying all day long...

203
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Really, the stress...

204
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I tried to control it as much as I could

205
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
but...

206
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I remember studying with a lot of stress

207
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
because it was so intense.

208
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Really, all the students...

209
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
really...

210
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I sincerely support you.

211
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You're really amazing.

212
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Being able to do something so passionately

213
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
is really really amazing

214
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and cool.

215
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So...

216
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Have pride.

217
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Don't get too stressed...

218
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Don't get too stressed...

219
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Don't get too stressed...

220
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Don't get too stressed...

221
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Don't get too stressed...

222
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Fighting!

223
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You can do it.

224
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm still not...

225
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm still not...

226
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm still not...

227
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm still not...

228
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Do you think pineapple belongs to pizza?

229
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Do you think pineapple belongs to pizza?

230
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I don't know.

231
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I don't know.

232
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I don't know.

233
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Do you think I belong...

234
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Do you think I belong...

235
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Do you think I belong...

236
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Wait, no.

237
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I was trying to say

238
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
do you think I belong on the syrup

239
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
but that would mean

240
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I think pineapple belongs on pizza.

241
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I think pineapple belongs on pizza.

242
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yeah.

243
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The answer is no

244
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I don't think it belongs to pizza.

245
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I don't think it belongs to pizza.

246
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,200
I'm used to pizza

247
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:24,380
I'm also good at

248
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Ah! Oh, Yunjung, did you eat pho? I actually just had pho with Chaewon and Zuha.

249
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Put some decorations up on my room?

250
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
This is actually the plainest part of my room. Like, my room is actually a mess. I cannot show you anything more.

251
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Like, this is, it's such a bad, it's in such a bad state right now.

252
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
My ukulele's here, and like...

253
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Oh, it's still fairly in tune. Oh, there's my guitar.

254
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Oh, it's still not in tune.

255
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Oh, it's still not in tune.

256
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Oh, it's still not in tune.

257
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Oh, it's still not in tune.

258
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yeah.

259
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Sounds like my morning alarm. Yeah, that is true.

260
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Double take.

261
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm gonna sing the crowds and listen from the crowds. I don't see nobody but you.

262
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Also, this book.

263
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I forgot, I brought it over just to show you guys.

264
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
This book is so good.

265
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I've mentioned it a few times, but...

266
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's so good.

267
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Very relatable.

268
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Do I play Minecraft? I used to play Minecraft.

269
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Like, the mobile version.

270
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
This is not a real plant.

271
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Have you tried using Kymak?

272
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
K-Mak?

273
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Have I ever tried Kymak? K-Mak?

274
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I have.

275
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's very good.

276
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I had it with Zuha.

277
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's very good.

278
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I had it with Zuha.

279
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Girl, buy a bookshelf. Those books are gonna take over.

280
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
That is a bookshelf.

281
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's a bookshelf, but like, it's just where you have the books, like, sideways.

282
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So there's like a shelf there. You just can't see it because it's between the books.

283
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So there's like a shelf there. You just can't see it because it's between the books.

284
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So there's like a shelf there. You just can't see it because it's between the books.

285
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm so scared of long-term flights. It's tiring. What are you doing in a plane, Yoonjin?

286
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Uh, me? I...

287
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I either sleep.

288
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I usually sleep.

289
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I either sleep or...

290
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I don't know.

291
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I either sleep or...

292
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I think I listen to music a lot while reading books or listening to music.

293
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I think I listen to music a lot while reading books or listening to music.

294
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Everyone, do you watch Black and White Cookers these days?

295
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's so much fun.

296
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's so cool.

297
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Almost all the people who appear on the show are really, really cool.

298
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Totally respect.

299
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
What song should I listen to?

300
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Then...

301
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Everyone, do you have a song request?

302
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Last time, we were in the States.

303
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Have you listened to this song before?

304
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Yes.

305
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I really love this song.

306
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Here we go.

307
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It's so cool.

308
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm going to take a shower and go to bed.

309
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm going to take a shower and go to bed.

310
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I'm going to take a shower and go to bed.

311
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm going to take a shower and go to bed.

312
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I'm going to take a shower and go to bed.

313
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I'm going to take a shower and go to bed.

314
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I'm going to take a shower and go to bed.

315
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I'm going to take a shower and go to bed.

316
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I'm going to take a shower and go to bed.

317
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I'm going to take a shower and go to bed.

318
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I'm going to take a shower and go to bed.

319
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm going to take a shower and go to bed.

320
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I'm going to take a shower and...

321
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,080
Can I marry Rachel? NOOOOO

322
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,000
Oh, her hair looks mysterious.

323
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Oh, her hair looks mysterious.

324
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
oh well I did like science in high school

325
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Oh well I did like science in high school

326
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I wonder if she doesn't use these fun glasses.

327
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:31,400
I bought this plate at a vintage shop.

328
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,240
Glasses! Glasses!

329
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:40,960
What should I say?

330
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:47,760
I'm using this as a display.

331
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:57,860
I'm going to turn the BGM down and listen to some music.

332
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:05,760
What should I listen to?

333
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:32,300
While you're listening to this.

334
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,200
Glasses!

335
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,060
Now what should I say?

336
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,280
What should I say?

337
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,940
Try On?

338
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,360
I'll give it a shot.

339
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,220
This song is so...

340
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,540
Hayley Knox's Eleventh Hour.

341
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:47,660
It's in Stardust.

342
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,760
It's Heine Knox... Knox? Knox?

343
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,760
It's Knox.

344
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,760
I'm obsessed with her.

345
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,760
First glasses.

346
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,760
These are the glasses.

347
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,760
I have glasses like this.

348
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,760
I think I wore this once when I danced.

349
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,760
Chaewon wears this often.

350
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,760
This one, too.

351
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,760
I think I wore this in America.

352
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,760
By any chance...

353
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,760
Is the picture not good?

354
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,760
Is the picture not good?

355
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,760
Is it done?

356
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,760
Is it okay?

357
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,760
Is it okay now?

358
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,760
Is it okay?

359
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,760
Is it okay?

360
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
I think it's okay.

361
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,760
Is it okay now?

362
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,760
I can't see it?

363
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,760
The picture quality?

364
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,760
I'll turn it back on.

365
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,760
Hold on.

366
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,760
Hang on.

367
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,760
Hang on.
