00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:01,033
Hi

2
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:09,967
It's Yunjin

3
00:00:13,967 --> 00:00:14,967
It's going well, right?

4
00:00:19,967 --> 00:00:20,967
What's up

5
00:00:29,967 --> 00:00:34,967
I'm in my room

6
00:00:42,967 --> 00:00:44,867
It's not a perm

7
00:00:44,967 --> 00:00:46,967
I have a shoot today

8
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:53,967
I have a shoot

9
00:00:55,967 --> 00:00:57,967
I took off my hair

10
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:00,967
I took off my hair

11
00:01:03,967 --> 00:01:04,967
A perm?

12
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:10,967
I had my hair curled

13
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:14,967
That's right, I had a shoot today

14
00:01:27,967 --> 00:01:28,867
What's up

15
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:29,867
Where are you this late?

16
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:30,967
I'm at home

17
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:33,933
I'm at the dorm

18
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:40,933
Do you have time?

19
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:42,933
Yes, I have time

20
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:44,933
Time is

21
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:47,933
Like this

22
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:52,933
I always come when I have time

23
00:01:54,933 --> 00:01:55,833
What shoot do I have today?

24
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:56,933
Today

25
00:01:58,933 --> 00:01:59,833
I washed my hair

26
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:00,933
To my house

27
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:03,933
I'm coming

28
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:09,833
Did you do your hair?

29
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:10,933
Yes

30
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:12,933
How do you feel?

31
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:14,833
Everybody

32
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:16,900
Ye turtle

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,667
You have asta hair

34
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:20,833
Yes

35
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:21,933
It's good

36
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:24,833
Yes

37
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:25,833
Fantastic

38
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:26,833
Yes

39
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:30,933
Do I play any games? I
unfortunately don't play any games.

40
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:41,933
Can you introduce me to
one of the books in the back?

41
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:45,833
Okay.

42
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:47,933
Hold on a second.

43
00:02:56,933 --> 00:02:57,933
Let me see.

44
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:27,933
Hmm.

45
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:40,933
Yeah.

46
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:47,933
Hmm.

47
00:03:56,933 --> 00:03:57,933
Hmm.

48
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,900
What's up?

49
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,800
Oh, what did I think of the UK?

50
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,900
It was so great. I had such a good time.

51
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,800
Oh, yeah.

52
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,900
Okay.

53
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,800
The Book Thief.

54
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,800
I've talked about this book a lot, but

55
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,800
I think it's actually

56
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,800
like a modern

57
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,900
book that will become

58
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,800
a classic,

59
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,900
I think.

60
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,800
It's very, very good.

61
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,900
It talks about...

62
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,900
Oh, my gosh.

63
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,800
Oh, there's so much

64
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,900
mungy.

65
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,100
Yeah.

66
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,800
It's about

67
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,567
the power of

68
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,167
like reading and books
and imagination in

69
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:41,800
really harrowing times
because it's, you know,

70
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,800
based off of a real historical event.

71
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,800
How many books are in that book tower?

72
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,800
I don't know.

73
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,800
It's six movies.

74
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,800
Thank you.

75
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,633
You know,

76
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:56,633
I think so.

77
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:57,733
It's cool.

78
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,800
It's cool.

79
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,900
This.

80
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,800
And it's,

81
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,900
I don't know.

82
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,600
There's a lot of like
generational stuff which

83
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,900
is something that feels
really familiar to me.

84
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,600
Like immigrants.

85
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:44,467
Buy a bookshelf? I do have a
bookshelf but that's already stacked.

86
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,867
What's the most recent
Japanese word I remember?

87
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:01,633
Giri giri (just barely)

88
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,767
But what if it falls over?

89
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,767
It won't fall over.

90
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:19,767
Because it's a steel bookshelf.

91
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:23,767
It's not just like this.

92
00:07:23,867 --> 00:07:25,767
It's vertical.

93
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:26,767
How do you say it?

94
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:29,867
It's like lying down.

95
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,767
Hair? I didn't dye my hair but

96
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:46,867
Fiona kept telling me that I dyed my hair.

97
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,767
I think I get a lot of light.

98
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:52,867
I didn't dye my hair.

99
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:57,567
I think it's the same blue.

100
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:08,867
It's the same blue but if
it's dark it looks like black.

101
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,367
How was Swiss?
Switzerland

102
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:43,300
Oh my god.
Switzerland

103
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,767
Switzerland was so beautiful

104
00:08:45,867 --> 00:08:47,767
We were really

105
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:51,367
Since I became a trainee, for
the first time in a long time, I spent

106
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:58,233
time with my family, and it was

107
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:02,400
really, really,
really, really good.

108
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,867
It was so good.

109
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:10,767
What do you drink? I drink Yonana.
<i>(banana yogurt??)</i>

110
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:16,100
I shouldn't
drink coffee at this time

111
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,533
but I drank it because I love it

112
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:21,667
so good

113
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:24,767
But I still sleep well. Don't worry.

114
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:30,400
But don't drink coffee at a late
time, especially when you're young.

115
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,533
Do you understand?
Drink decaffeinated coffee.

116
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:37,533
It's a little hard to order again.

117
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:48,733
Do I sleep well? I
think I sleep fairly well.

118
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:55,267
Do I miss Rachel? Yes,
I miss Rachel so much.

119
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,733
What is my coffee order?

120
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:03,733
Just an iced Americano.
Black. I like black coffee.

121
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:12,200
Make a heart?

122
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,300
What country do you want
to go to after Switzerland?

123
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,433
There are so many
countries I want to go to,

124
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:28,400
so I think I need to
write a bucket list.

125
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,733
There are so many.
Anywhere. Any new country.

126
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:37,833
Any new city. Anywhere. I love everything.

127
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:43,733
London was really good too.

128
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:46,833
Fish and chips are good.

129
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:55,733
And a lot of curry as well. I love curry.

130
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,833
I love curry so much.

131
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,100
Can you do a heart?

132
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,733
Oh, so comfortable. Thank you.

133
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,733
Because you are here
while I'm eating. I love you.

134
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,400
Aww.

135
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,733
Yeah, everybody, I hope you can
get a good snack while you watch.

136
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:28,733
Favorite topping on pizza?
Broccoli and ricotta cheese.

137
00:11:30,233 --> 00:11:31,233
Or...

138
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:36,500
I don't know. I like, I like me
a white pizza with broccoli.

139
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:44,867
Or, like, greens and, um, I don't
know, cheese. Like, ricotta cheese.

140
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:49,733
And also, I just like a margarita. Like,
basil, basil leaves. That's really good too.

141
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:53,733
Have you read The Seven
Husbands of Evelyn Hugo?

142
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:58,667
I have not, but Rachel is obsessed with
that book. She, it's her favorite book.

143
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:01,767
So, hopefully one day I will.

144
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,833
"Broccoli" Yall are hating on broccoli?

145
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:17,233
Ricotta does go crazy on pizza.

146
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,400
It goes what?

147
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:23,733
Can I eat the jjapaghetti on Yunjin's head?

148
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:27,700
It's blue. Would you be okay with that?

149
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,700
Ribbons.

150
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,700
It's dessert.

151
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:42,500
The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is good?

152
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:45,700
My mom used to have that book

153
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,167
back at home

154
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,700
How does it feel to perform
at a festival after a long time?

155
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,700
Really really really fun.

156
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,700
Seriously...

157
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,700
I kept talking to the members
and they said it was really fun.

158
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,700
It was really really fun.

159
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,700
It was really fun and...

160
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,700
Really...

161
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,700
The energy and the heat

162
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,700
were no joke.

163
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:22,767
Really...

164
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,700
For me, when I watch a performance

165
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,167
or when I perform,

166
00:13:32,267 --> 00:13:36,567
everyone in that space feels liberated

167
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:37,967
and really...

168
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,700
become one mind, one body

169
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,700
and really...

170
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,567
just...

171
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:50,033
Forget about that moment
and just enjoy everything.

172
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:53,400
That's how I feel.

173
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,333
It's like...

174
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:57,700
Everyone enjoyed it so much

175
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,700
so it was really...

176
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,700
good and if we could give

177
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,267
a little bit of good energy,

178
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:09,733
I don't think there's
anything better than that.

179
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,267
Really really...

180
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:13,700
I'm looking forward to it in the future

181
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:16,700
and I'll do my best.

182
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:19,367
Ah! I'll look forward
to the Hoseo Festival!

183
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:21,267
I'll look forward to it!

184
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:22,700
I'll definitely...

185
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,867
go and see it!

186
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,700
The college entrance exam!

187
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,900
There's 47 days left, nuna.

188
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,567
Fighting!

189
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,700
Fighting fighting! Fighting!

190
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,700
Fighting for the college entrance exam!

191
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,167
I also...

192
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:42,267
The US...

193
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:45,033
college entrance exam?

194
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:47,200
A few years ago...

195
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,000
I really...
prepared for it.

196
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:55,433
But it was really...
really hard.

197
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:57,933
Studying all day long...

198
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,367
oh...
Really, the stress...

199
00:15:04,467 --> 00:15:07,367
I tried to control it as much as I could

200
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:08,667
but...

201
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:12,667
I remember studying with a lot of stress

202
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:14,100
because it was so intense.

203
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,633
Really, all the students...

204
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:19,667
really...

205
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:21,667
I sincerely support you.

206
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:23,667
You're really amazing.

207
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:27,667
Being able to do something so passionately

208
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:29,667
is really really amazing

209
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:31,667
and cool.

210
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:33,667
So...

211
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,667
Have pride.

212
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:43,767
Don't get too stressed...

213
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:47,667
Fighting!

214
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:49,933
You can do it.

215
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:07,767
I'm still not...

216
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,667
Do you think pineapple belongs to pizza?

217
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,667
I don't know.

218
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:21,267
Do you think I belong...

219
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,333
Wait, no.
I was trying to say

220
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:27,833
do you think I belong on the syrup
but that would mean

221
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:31,000
I think pineapple belongs on pizza.

222
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:40,933
Yeah. The answer is no I don't think
it belongs to pizza.

223
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:49,067
Would you like to come to Italy?
Yes, I would love to go to Italy.

224
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:00,033
Yunjin are you in London?
No! I'm not in London! I'm in... Seoul!

225
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:01,700
Yongsan actually

226
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:05,833
Do I like Daniel Ceaser?
Yes, of course!

227
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:08,233
Have you ever been to Texas?
I have not.

228
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:43,067
Ah! Oh, Yunjin, did you eat pho? I
actually just had pho with Chaewon

229
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
and Zuha.

230
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Put some decorations up on my room?

231
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:01,067
This is actually the plainest
part of my room.

232
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:04,633
Like, my room is actually a mess. I
cannot show you anything more.

233
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:11,400
Like, this is, it's such a bad,
it's in such a bad state right now.

234
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:16,333
My ukulele's here, and like...

235
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:27,300
Oh, it's still fairly in tune.
Oh, there's my guitar.

236
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Yeah.

237
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:31,100
Sounds like my morning
alarm. Yeah, that is true.

238
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:34,100
Double take.

239
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,367
In the midst of the crowds

240
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,433
In the shapes in the clouds

241
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:43,067
I don't see nobody but you

242
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:45,167
Also, this book.
<i>(red helicopter)</i>

243
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,500
I forgot, I brought it over
just to show you guys.

244
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,733
This book is so good.

245
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,500
I've mentioned it a few times, but...

246
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
It's so good.

247
00:19:58,967 --> 00:19:59,967
Very relatable.

248
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,500
Do I play Minecraft? I
used to play Minecraft.

249
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,200
But like the mobile version.

250
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:13,367
This is not a real plant.

251
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:21,400
Have you tried using Kaymak?

252
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,033
Kaymak?

253
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:26,167
Have I ever tried Kaymak? Kaymak?

254
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:27,600
I have. It's very good.

255
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,167
It's very good.

256
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:30,267
I had it with Zuha.

257
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:40,067
Girl, buy a bookshelf. Those
books are gonna tip over.

258
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:40,633
That is a bookshelf.

259
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:46,700
It's a bookshelf, but like, it's just where
you have the books, like, sideways.

260
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:49,767
So there's like a shelf there.

261
00:20:49,867 --> 00:20:52,400
You just can't see it because
it's between the books.

262
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,967
I'm so scared of
long-term flights. It's tiring.

263
00:20:58,067 --> 00:21:01,333
What are you
doing in a plane, Yoonjin?

264
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:04,067
Uh, me? I...

265
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:08,933
I either sleep.

266
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:10,167
I usually sleep.

267
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:11,267
I either sleep or...

268
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:14,433
I don't know.

269
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:15,533
I either sleep or...

270
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,067
I think I listen to music a lot while
reading books or listening to music.

271
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:38,500
Do I have a name for
my guitar and my ukelele?

272
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,433
I used to, you know I actually
did! I used to, but I don't remember.

273
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,667
I think I listen to music a lot while
reading books or listening to music.

274
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,467
JenJen mwah hyejong

275
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:00,567
mwah

276
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:06,633
Guys, we should listen to some music

277
00:22:06,733 --> 00:22:09,600
or like do something fun. Gimme a sec.

278
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,500
Oh, everyone, look at the black and white
cook these days.

279
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,733
It's so much fun.

280
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:21,633
It's so cool.

281
00:22:21,733 --> 00:22:28,700
Almost all the people who appear
on the show are really, really cool.

282
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:31,700
Totally respect.

283
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,700
What song should I listen to?

284
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,700
Then...

285
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,167
Everyone, do you have a song request?

286
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:51,600
Have I tried kompokoki yet?
Yes, I did. I had some with Rachel.

287
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,967
Last time, we were in the States.

288
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
Oh my god

289
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:19,133
Have you listened to this song before?

290
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:26,700
Okay

291
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,433
it's a song that I'm... like
currently obsessed with

292
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:32,767
It's so good.

293
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:35,167
It's Orion Sun's.

294
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:36,267
Already Gone

295
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,667
I really love this song.

296
00:24:01,033 --> 00:24:02,967
It's so cool.

297
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:03,567
Oh, her hair looks mysterious.

298
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:07,567
Oh well I did like science in high school

299
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:09,667
I wonder if she doesn't
use these fun glasses.

300
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,267
I bought this plate at a vintage shop.

301
00:25:31,367 --> 00:25:32,867
Glasses! Glasses!

302
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:40,800
What should I say?

303
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:47,567
I'm using this as a display.

304
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:55,667
I'm going to turn the BGM
down and listen to some music.

305
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,033
What should I listen to?

306
00:26:21,267 --> 00:26:25,400
Already gone

307
00:26:31,767 --> 00:26:33,733
Glasses!

308
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:39,000
Now what should I say?
What should I say?

309
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,967
Try On?

310
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:42,400
I'll give it a shot.

311
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,300
This song is so...

312
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,400
it's Hailey Knox Eleventh Hour

313
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,333
It's Hailey Knox... Knox? Knox?

314
00:26:51,433 --> 00:26:54,400
It's Knox.

315
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,500
I'm obsessed with her.

316
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:58,533
First glasses.

317
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,000
These are the glasses.

318
00:27:19,933 --> 00:27:25,033
[Stream began to lag here]

319
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:29,300
I have glasses like this.
I think I wore this once when I danced.

320
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Chaewon wears this often.

321
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
This one, too.

322
00:27:56,267 --> 00:27:59,400
I think I wore this in America.

323
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:05,000
By any chance...

324
00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:13,533
Is the video not good?

325
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,367
Is the picture not good?
Is it done?

326
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,667
Is it okay?

327
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,700
Is it okay now?

328
00:28:34,967 --> 00:28:37,600
Is it okay?

329
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,000
I think it's okay.

330
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:44,333
Is it okay now?

331
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,433
I can't see it?
The picture quality?

332
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:54,700
I'll turn it back on.
Hold on. Hang on.

333
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,267
Are you okay?
Okay.

334
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:04,667
Here we go again, okay.

335
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:06,633
This is...

336
00:29:10,133 --> 00:29:13,833
These are glasses that
I've never worn outside.

337
00:29:13,933 --> 00:29:17,933
Okay, wait.
This is a good part.

338
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:24,533
This too.

339
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:31,833
These are my glasses.

340
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:37,267
This is so cool,

341
00:29:37,367 --> 00:29:39,267
but it hurts when I wear it.

342
00:29:39,367 --> 00:29:41,367
Because I can't see it well.

343
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,633
There's a delay.

344
00:30:07,733 --> 00:30:09,467
I'm going crazy.

345
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:11,867
The sync doesn't work
because I'm going crazy?

346
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:17,500
The sync doesn't work?

347
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,767
What's going on?

348
00:30:18,867 --> 00:30:20,100
Really?

349
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,200
Hold on.

350
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:37,367
I'm going crazy.

351
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,900
The place you can go.

352
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,400
Really?
No.

353
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,400
No?

354
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:54,933
Is it cut?

355
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:58,633
Oh, my God.
Really?

356
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,000
Can't you hear the sound?

357
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,100
What's wrong with you?

358
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,000
I can't even put it in color.

359
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:23,433
Okay. End.

360
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,100
Ah!

361
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,033
Is this some kind of punishment?

362
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:43,167
Everyone 
please be understanding

363
00:31:43,267 --> 00:31:44,633
It's a livestream

364
00:31:44,733 --> 00:31:47,133
I will check the video later

365
00:31:47,233 --> 00:31:51,267
there is a bug in the livestream.

366
00:31:56,533 --> 00:31:59,000
Let's not worry about
it too much. It's a bug.

367
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:01,733
Keshi

368
00:32:03,967 --> 00:32:08,767
Bodies

369
00:32:13,467 --> 00:32:15,633
아민 처 버린다
(?) Oh, seriously, toss it!

370
00:32:54,633 --> 00:32:58,600
Sorry
I messed up the melody for that.

371
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,267
This is Keshi.

372
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:43,900
These are my lenses.

373
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:20,333
goodbye, I really don't know

374
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:30,000
Accessories like glasses, besides
buying glasses, this has that flavor.

375
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:44,567
This is what I've been using.

376
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,067
This is a real glasses.

377
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:05,333
There's a number of them,
so my eyes are a little smaller.

378
00:35:06,967 --> 00:35:09,100
Oh, look at the dirt.

379
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,267
It's been a while since I've used it.

380
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,067
Wow

381
00:35:21,133 --> 00:35:23,433
I need to organize my glasses.

382
00:35:23,533 --> 00:35:26,500
Among these, I still have the most

383
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,933
I'm going to organize my glasses.

384
00:35:30,633 --> 00:35:36,300
The best glasses for this look right now.

385
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:42,033
First of all, the song is so good.

386
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,733
I think I need to put it in the oven.

387
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:52,333
180 degrees for 30 minutes

388
00:35:52,433 --> 00:35:56,000
What I think is the most important thing is

389
00:35:57,167 --> 00:36:00,767
Cooking

390
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,833
We're going to be tight.

391
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:12,767
pretty good at that

392
00:36:12,867 --> 00:36:14,667
no, it's really kinda

393
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:16,933
the taste is very rich

394
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:25,667
Well, today

395
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,733
Since I made a pretty makeup,

396
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:29,133
I'm going to do it on my own

397
00:38:15,567 --> 00:38:18,200
cool sound

398
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,933
I really like it

399
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,767
Isn't it so good?

400
00:38:43,867 --> 00:38:45,967
It's called see through
by Amelia Moore

401
00:38:58,533 --> 00:39:00,700
What other songs do
you think there will be?

402
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,233
Ah!

403
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,500
Wait a minute

404
00:39:15,067 --> 00:39:16,033
Try writing it

405
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:29,633
this...

406
00:39:37,133 --> 00:39:39,133
I'll show you the guitar

407
00:40:58,467 --> 00:41:01,533
it's difficult

408
00:41:09,933 --> 00:41:11,533
Do you know this song, everyone?

409
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,733
Okay, my guitar is
still out of tune, though.

410
00:42:24,133 --> 00:42:25,567
I love ceilings.

411
00:42:35,633 --> 00:42:39,800
Okay, I'm still practicing, so I don't
think I can show you like a full cover,

412
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:43,067
but,

413
00:42:43,167 --> 00:42:46,400
Guys, are you curious
about the jellyfish song?

414
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:50,933
Let's see.

415
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:38,667
Should I show you the track first?

416
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,533
And there's another story about jellyfish.

417
00:45:01,633 --> 00:45:04,967
No, yesterday, I gave
Eunchae something

418
00:45:08,433 --> 00:45:13,267
gave her something.

419
00:45:13,367 --> 00:45:15,900
I went to find Eunchae.

420
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,733
So I was going to give something
to Eunchae and come back down.

421
00:45:20,833 --> 00:45:25,533
Suddenly, Eunchae opened this.

422
00:45:37,733 --> 00:45:42,567
Eunchae said he had a hard time with VMA.

423
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:44,167
So I bought this for him.

424
00:45:44,267 --> 00:45:46,467
I gave her this.

425
00:45:46,567 --> 00:45:49,567
No, that's why it's so...

426
00:45:54,967 --> 00:45:56,667
I gave her this.

427
00:45:56,767 --> 00:46:00,000
Isn't it so cute?

428
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,600
But this isn't the end.

429
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,833
You said you still have
something to give her.

430
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,700
It's so touching.

431
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,833
I'm going to put it in my bag again.

432
00:46:21,567 --> 00:46:23,800
I was so touched.

433
00:46:30,033 --> 00:46:31,600
Okay.

434
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:36,033
Then, I have something to do tomorrow.

435
00:46:36,133 --> 00:46:39,633
Look at the time.
It's already 12 o'clock.

436
00:46:39,733 --> 00:46:40,567
Yes.

437
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:42,233
I'll go.

438
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:49,700
I'll listen to a song for the last time.

439
00:46:51,067 --> 00:46:52,467
And then I'll go.

440
00:47:02,967 --> 00:47:04,833
Oh, Chaewon's mood light.

441
00:47:04,933 --> 00:47:06,467
What happened?

442
00:47:06,567 --> 00:47:07,933
I saw it.

443
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:09,033
And then...

444
00:47:11,267 --> 00:47:13,000
That...

445
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,067
Battery?

446
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:17,567
What are we talking about in Korean?

447
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,467
I can't fingertips.

448
00:47:21,567 --> 00:47:25,033
I still haven't installed it.

449
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,767
Are you going to put that up
again when you do that, too?

450
00:47:29,867 --> 00:47:33,100
No, when I get it, it's really...

451
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,067
No, I have been moving too much.

452
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,233
That's the only thing that came to my mind.

453
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:39,467
How can you give me such a sensible gift?

454
00:47:39,567 --> 00:47:42,000
It's the same for Eunchae.

455
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,033
I mean, that's what I like.

456
00:47:44,133 --> 00:47:47,033
Oh, it's obvious.

457
00:47:47,133 --> 00:47:49,533
It's obvious.

458
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:53,700
I'm a bit of a transparent person.

459
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:58,533
But I thought about giving it to you.

460
00:47:58,633 --> 00:48:00,167
I'm so touched.

461
00:48:00,267 --> 00:48:01,267
Really.

462
00:48:04,767 --> 00:48:06,967
It's really my type.

463
00:48:20,133 --> 00:48:21,467
Aha, okay.

464
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:24,400
Then let's end it with this.

465
00:48:28,167 --> 00:48:29,300
It was a good song, right?

466
00:48:32,533 --> 00:48:34,233


467
00:49:37,867 --> 00:49:39,500
Play a song by MCR?

468
00:49:40,867 --> 00:49:42,033
I would love to.

469
00:49:52,133 --> 00:49:54,667
Libra season is here.

470
00:49:54,767 --> 00:49:55,867
Oh my God.

471
00:49:55,967 --> 00:50:00,433
I didn't make a congratulatory
post about Libra season.

472
00:50:00,533 --> 00:50:04,533
I'm going to have to do
that in honor of Libra season

473
00:50:16,933 --> 00:50:18,433
Te amo

474
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,667
And then

475
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,700
This song is about

476
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,033
Yoo Jae Ha sunbaenim's

477
00:50:42,333 --> 00:50:43,333
Milestone

478
00:51:45,267 --> 00:51:51,567
Yunjin ah, when your parents listen to
that song I'll remember when I was young

479
00:52:06,267 --> 00:52:07,433
Should I turn off the lights?

480
00:52:12,233 --> 00:52:13,233
It's too dark

481
00:52:14,367 --> 00:52:17,200
I'll turn off the light

482
00:52:22,633 --> 00:52:25,633
It's time to put the Fearnot to rest

483
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,900
Jen a girl behind you?

484
00:52:37,633 --> 00:52:38,833
Who is it?

485
00:52:40,867 --> 00:52:41,867
Hank?

486
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,800
Isn't it time to sleep? Fearnot?

487
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,300
Is this the sound?

488
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,300
I feel like this is the best

489
00:55:42,833 --> 00:55:46,233
Happy birthday!
Today is your birthday?

490
00:55:50,467 --> 00:55:51,900
Lesserafim Two!

491
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,433
하 성면 파 쳐
(?) Let's face against the tide.

492
00:55:53,533 --> 00:55:54,667
I agree!

493
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,567
You look good on me?
Thank you

494
00:56:14,767 --> 00:56:18,500
Happy birthday!

495
00:56:22,133 --> 00:56:24,500
Fearnot why...

496
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,633
Aren't you going to sleep?

497
00:56:26,733 --> 00:56:29,267
The world is brighter after meeting YunJin?

498
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,733
The color got brighter?
No way, it's the same for me

499
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,600
No way, it's the same for me

500
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,600
How is it?

501
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,000
I really like this song

502
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,367
It's turned off?

503
00:59:26,467 --> 00:59:27,733
I'm going crazy

504
00:59:27,833 --> 00:59:29,700
Hey, I shouldn't sing

505
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,567
Ah, I'm going crazy

506
00:59:32,667 --> 00:59:33,667
Really?

507
00:59:36,567 --> 00:59:38,433
Ah, I'm going crazy Really?

508
00:59:39,467 --> 00:59:41,000
Then, before the last song

509
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:43,233
I'll sing a song

510
00:59:44,867 --> 00:59:46,567
Now, the last song.

511
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,433
I'm going to do one more
encore song after the last

512
00:59:52,533 --> 00:59:55,700
song. This is a song I
really, really, really cherish.

513
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,300
Seriously.

514
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:16,067
I sincerely love Wave to Earth.
Please listen to it.

515
01:00:22,033 --> 01:00:25,300
Wave to Earth
Love

516
01:02:21,433 --> 01:02:23,133
It's so good

517
01:02:24,867 --> 01:02:31,267
This ring is so pretty.

518
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:38,200
Wave to Earth, if you're
watching this, I love you.

519
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,200
Now, the last song.

520
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,967
I love you

521
01:06:30,467 --> 01:06:34,833
I think I did it for a really long time

522
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:39,100
About an hour and a half?

523
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:46,533
I'll put you to sleep tomorrow morning

524
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:51,600
I hope you sleep well

525
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:55,933
I'll clean up my room, remove
my makeup, and wash up

526
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:05,100
I'll go to bed now I love you

527
01:07:06,167 --> 01:07:08,233
Bye
