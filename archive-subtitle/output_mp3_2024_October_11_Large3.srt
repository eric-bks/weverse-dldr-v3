1
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:13,533


2
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:16,933
Hello?

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,620
Are you there?

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,980
hi

5
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:22,934


6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,020
Hi, hi

7
00:00:23,947 --> 00:00:24,935


8
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,960
Oh hi

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hi

10
00:00:37,713 --> 00:00:38,686


11
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:39,766


12
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:43,012
I dropped my phone

13
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,446
On my face!

14
00:00:47,211 --> 00:00:50,202
It's night so I should be quiet

15
00:00:51,554 --> 00:00:53,829
I dropped my phone on my face

16
00:00:54,308 --> 00:00:56,030
This big Galaxy

17
00:01:04,326 --> 00:01:06,664
Unnie, I finished my schedule

18
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:08,660
I washed and lay down

19
00:01:08,904 --> 00:01:13,422
I was so bored

20
00:01:15,134 --> 00:01:16,783
So I turned it on

21
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:26,553
Samuachi

22
00:01:27,138 --> 00:01:29,288
In Japanese, Samuachi

23
00:01:29,574 --> 00:01:30,574


24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Good night

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
"What did you do today?"

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Today?

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I filmed all day

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
There was a filming

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
"A story about vacation?"

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I went on vacation

31
00:01:49,554 --> 00:01:51,627
I went to Nha Trang with my family

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But they recognized me

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Because it was a vacation

34
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,567
And it was a holiday

35
00:01:58,863 --> 00:02:00,616
So most of the Koreans

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Most of the Koreans

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Most of the Koreans were Koreans

38
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,637
Those who came on a vacation

39
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,427
So many people recognized me

40
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:13,308
They called me a fan

41
00:02:13,962 --> 00:02:15,808
Because I was uncomfortable

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
When I was eating

43
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,875
When I was eating?

44
00:02:20,024 --> 00:02:21,964
They didn't pretend to know

45
00:02:22,031 --> 00:02:24,634
At the end, when we got a seat

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
They said, I'm a fan

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,815
And left

48
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:28,815
So

49
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:31,614
I was so thankful

50
00:02:32,262 --> 00:02:34,035
That little consideration

51
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:39,889
I was thankful

52
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:41,733
I was so happy

53
00:02:42,397 --> 00:02:43,735
Because they called me a fan

54
00:02:53,038 --> 00:02:54,651
And what was it?

55
00:02:54,998 --> 00:02:56,995
I didn't have to show

56
00:02:57,963 --> 00:02:59,610
I thought I was awesome

57
00:02:59,678 --> 00:03:00,996
Didn't become like a big fan

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Which is...

59
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:03,263


60
00:03:04,448 --> 00:03:06,288
Did you think it was a good song?

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I think so

62
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:07,775


63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,962
Balanced

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Because

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,684
I didn't have to hide

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,776
From my family

67
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:26,055
I just walked around like that, but there were a lot of tourists in front of me, and they were calling me.

68
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:30,969


69
00:03:31,138 --> 00:03:33,844


70
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:36,483


71
00:03:38,614 --> 00:03:41,194
Oh, that's why I'm so embarrassed.

72
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:49,726
Oh, so, wow. Oh, please, this is...

73
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:52,444
Oh, this is... Thank you so much for recognizing me, but if you took a picture, I really hope you don't post this.

74
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:56,464


75
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,247
I thought like this, but they didn't post it. Thank you.

76
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:01,175


77
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:02,424


78
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,432
I think when they saw it, they would have said, Oh, I shouldn't post this for Jaewon's sake.

79
00:04:06,499 --> 00:04:08,089


80
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,820
Maybe...

81
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,923
Really...

82
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:19,483


83
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Yes, please take care of me personally.

84
00:04:35,631 --> 00:04:37,835
"I'm drunk after eating Jinbin. Huh? I'm drunk after eating Jinbin?"

85
00:04:38,386 --> 00:04:40,400
How much did you drink?

86
00:04:44,187 --> 00:04:45,982
You can't drink well.

87
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:47,500
Okay.

88
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:47,600
Okay.

89
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
"Chaewon, what did you eat for dinner?"

90
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,157
I really think I'm going to be scolded by Fianna, but I didn't have dinner.

91
00:04:53,287 --> 00:04:55,763


92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,145
"What's the sound of a motorcycle?"

93
00:05:02,213 --> 00:05:04,493
I just opened the window in my room.

94
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,646
Can you even hear the sound of a motorcycle?

95
00:05:07,052 --> 00:05:08,685
That's amazing.

96
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:13,261
Jinbin, it's whiskey.

97
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:15,985
There's whiskey and highball.

98
00:05:16,052 --> 00:05:17,811
I thought you were talking about highball.

99
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:20,150
Fine.

100
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,022
It's a lot of free beers, so it's perfect.

101
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:27,022
"Do you think you could hold faded."

102
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,300
I'm thinking about it.

103
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:30,805
You don't think you should brutally hold it.

104
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,500
I'll press statusisé, so I won't do that voice ciassi.

105
00:05:31,962 --> 00:05:34,117


106
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,000
How about JinBin Market?

107
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,325


108
00:05:39,187 --> 00:05:40,295
How can I know that?

109
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,500
Jinbin Market.

110
00:05:40,362 --> 00:05:42,513
No response so far.

111
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,200
It's okay.

112
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,276
The lastSEV as this %.

113
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,276
Satisfaction is the best

114
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,430
"What did you learn in Japanese?"

115
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:06,135


116
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,720
Japanese...

117
00:06:10,207 --> 00:06:12,007


118
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Japanese...

119
00:06:17,594 --> 00:06:20,171
I learned something today

120
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:25,452
I don't know which side of my hair should I put on

121
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:26,939
No

122
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:36,652
I don't know which side of my hair should I put on

123
00:06:47,304 --> 00:06:49,313
This side or this side?

124
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,479


125
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
So cute

126
00:07:02,251 --> 00:07:11,088
Japanese people always call me kawaii

127
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:17,709
kawaii

128
00:07:17,776 --> 00:07:19,486
Piana is also kawaii

129
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:23,997


130
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:39,500
In Japan, is the weather hot right now?

131
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Is it cold?

132
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,479
Is it cold?

133
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,500
I will go to Japan soon

134
00:07:44,546 --> 00:07:47,805
Is it cold?

135
00:07:47,873 --> 00:07:48,614
Is it cold?

136
00:07:48,682 --> 00:07:51,115
It's cold in Korea too

137
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Soon, soon

138
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
Right, right

139
00:07:51,964 --> 00:07:59,166
I will go to Japan soon

140
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
Is it cold?

141
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,919
It's cold in Korea too

142
00:08:08,765 --> 00:08:09,967
Soon, soon

143
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:12,969
I will go to Japan soon

144
00:08:13,435 --> 00:08:16,587
How is the weather in Japan?

145
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
How is the weather in Japan?

146
00:08:19,463 --> 00:08:20,859
I understand

147
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:27,703
Isn't the weather so nice right now?

148
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:30,679
I really like this weather

149
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,444
It's a cool weather

150
00:08:33,603 --> 00:08:34,603
It's a cool weather

151
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,639
In a way, it's cold

152
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
In a way, it's a cool weather

153
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:43,503
"Is it too cold?"

154
00:08:43,571 --> 00:08:45,012
But for me

155
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Winter is colder

156
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,500
I think it's perfect now

157
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,585
Sorry

158
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,994
I can't read Chinese characters

159
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
I can't read Chinese characters

160
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,824
It's warmer than in Korea

161
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
It's warmer than in Korea

162
00:09:06,053 --> 00:09:09,204
Is it warm?

163
00:09:09,272 --> 00:09:13,054
Ah, it's warmer than in Korea.

164
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
It doesn't make a sound?

165
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,236
"What did I say?"

166
00:09:21,158 --> 00:09:22,685
I'm sorry.

167
00:09:22,753 --> 00:09:28,485
I have a Japanese piano, so I spoke Japanese.

168
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,027
What?

169
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
"Do you recommend me a late-night snack?"

170
00:09:40,343 --> 00:09:42,151
I really like ssambap these days.

171
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:47,399
I had ssambap for lunch today.

172
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:51,143
But ssambap came out so well these days.

173
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:55,884
You can eat it in one bite.

174
00:09:55,992 --> 00:09:59,171
It's a wrap.

175
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
So it was so delicious.

176
00:10:02,953 --> 00:10:06,484
I want to sell a lot of ssambap.

177
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,500
Ssambap.

178
00:10:07,301 --> 00:10:08,839
There aren't many places to deliver ssambap.

179
00:10:31,603 --> 00:10:32,818
I'm hungry.

180
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:35,004
I'm not hungry all the time.

181
00:10:37,482 --> 00:10:39,945
I'm hungry before I go to bed.

182
00:10:41,631 --> 00:10:42,909
What's wrong with you?

183
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:49,662
"Recommend me a good song to listen to when you study."

184
00:10:49,853 --> 00:10:52,586
Just study when you study.

185
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
Don't listen to music.

186
00:11:00,302 --> 00:11:05,169
Or listen to something that focuses well.

187
00:11:39,015 --> 00:11:42,140
I want to do black hair or brown hair instead of bleaching next time.

188
00:11:50,315 --> 00:11:56,178
I just happened to see a picture of me with long hair.

189
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,500
So I want to grow my hair.

190
00:12:02,297 --> 00:12:04,270
How can I grow my hair?

191
00:12:04,338 --> 00:12:08,379
I can't grow my hair because I want to grow it.

192
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:13,877
That's why I have hair extensions.

193
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:18,474
But it hurts when I have hair extensions.

194
00:12:21,982 --> 00:12:23,570
I want to grow my long hair with my own hair.

195
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,500
Q. What do you want to do next time?

196
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,500
Can you wait for me for a while?

197
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Can you wait for me?

198
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,334
"Q. Chaewon, have you ever done a long hair album?"

199
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
Oh my god.

200
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,500
That's right.

201
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:57,544
Don't keep seducing me.

202
00:12:51,452 --> 00:12:54,176
I suddenly want to do a long hair album.

203
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,544


204
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
I'll wait for you.

205
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:03,074
Really?

206
00:13:04,494 --> 00:13:07,610
But I really want to grow my hair.

207
00:13:10,278 --> 00:13:13,126
I think it takes a few years.

208
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
You look good in short hair.

209
00:13:16,336 --> 00:13:18,796
"You're short too?"

210
00:13:19,222 --> 00:13:21,338
Wait, Piyeon.

211
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
Let's be united.

212
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:27,933
Piyeon, let's be together.

213
00:13:39,596 --> 00:13:41,947
"Okay. I want to grow it, too."

214
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:13,166
"I'll do anything."

215
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
You like everything.

216
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
Sorry.

217
00:14:17,927 --> 00:14:18,800


218
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:21,122
Tell me you like everything.

219
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,453
Okay.

220
00:14:27,795 --> 00:14:30,316
I'll decide now.
I've heard a lot of opinions.

221
00:14:30,383 --> 00:14:32,698
I'm going to think about it a lot.

222
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:37,235
I'll think of a way to satisfy both long-haired and short-haired people.

223
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:40,554


224
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,500
What about the other members?

225
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
waterproof

226
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Yes.

227
00:14:53,537 --> 00:14:56,780
"I'm going to take care of my makeup with them this year."

228
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,362
Oh, my gosh!

229
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
"Chaewon, you scored a goal in Korean!"

230
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,374


231
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,500
Congratulations!

232
00:15:16,442 --> 00:15:17,927


233
00:15:19,737 --> 00:15:21,451
What about soccer?

234
00:15:19,737 --> 00:15:23,077


235
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:31,791


236
00:15:32,493 --> 00:15:33,501


237
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,524


238
00:15:52,983 --> 00:15:54,088


239
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
What do you think of this sound?

240
00:16:08,131 --> 00:16:09,063


241
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:20,384


242
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,400


243
00:16:33,337 --> 00:16:34,837


244
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Yeah, that's nice.

245
00:16:36,814 --> 00:16:40,341


246
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,300
I've seen it in my previous videos

247
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:59,268
You've all seen it, right?

248
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,406


249
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,800
But I think you're really amazing.

250
00:17:23,304 --> 00:17:25,653
How can you cook like that?

251
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,300
I mean, it's amazing that you're so good at cooking,

252
00:17:27,308 --> 00:17:30,777
I mean, it's amazing that you're so good at cooking,

253
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,074
but when you look at the ingredients,

254
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:34,935


255
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,300
Oh, I'm going to make this dish.

256
00:17:35,002 --> 00:17:38,882


257
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,300
How can you think of making this new dish?

258
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,820
I think you're really, really amazing.

259
00:17:48,643 --> 00:17:52,783
"What's your favorite song among the songs of Sabrina Carpenter?"

260
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,300
Me?

261
00:17:53,242 --> 00:17:55,429
There are so many.

262
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,300
But there are so many.

263
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,379
What should I do?

264
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,005
Among them,

265
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,300
I can't choose.

266
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,300
I'm hungry.

267
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,300
There's nothing wrong with the fire and turn it on.

268
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,300
It's just the fire.

269
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:37,730
HOLY dressed

270
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,300
I have to make another turn.

271
00:18:44,006 --> 00:18:46,985
"It doesn't matter."

272
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:49,232
Anyways.

273
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:51,873
I won't be able to mesmo this story.

274
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:54,761
If you don't do it, I won't do it.

275
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,300
It's too late now.

276
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,300
No.

277
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,300
Did I catch a cold?

278
00:19:05,415 --> 00:19:06,724
"Did I catch a cold?"

279
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,300
"Why?"

280
00:19:08,842 --> 00:19:10,008
I didn't catch a cold.

281
00:19:11,642 --> 00:19:13,706


282
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,300
Why is that?

283
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,300
Is my voice weird?

284
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:27,024
"Do you get more views when you cook ramen?"

285
00:19:27,092 --> 00:19:29,970
Don't say that.

286
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,940
I don't eat ramen.

287
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,300
"Oh my god."

288
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,300
No.

289
00:19:41,355 --> 00:19:42,855


290
00:19:47,576 --> 00:19:50,128
"No."

291
00:19:50,449 --> 00:19:51,470
Because it's before I go to bed.

292
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,469
Right?

293
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,300
It's my voice.

294
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,300
I always speak in a high tone.

295
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,300
I always speak in a high tone.

296
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,300
I always speak in a high tone.

297
00:20:03,565 --> 00:20:05,293
"Can you turn on the camera?"

298
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,300
I'm sorry.

299
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
I'm...

300
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,300
I'm not ready for my face.

301
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,300
But my face is so pretty when it's hot.

302
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,300
"The color is so pretty."

303
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,300
You care terribly when you're hot.

304
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,300
Oh, this is really hot.

305
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,300
So hot.

306
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:37,884


307
00:20:37,952 --> 00:20:40,432
Is that all?

308
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,300
Oh, is it?

309
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,685
I was walking with my mom and my sister, and they knocked on my door and asked me if I was Kim Chaemon.

310
00:20:57,027 --> 00:21:05,118
I was the first person to recognize him when I started traveling.

311
00:21:05,185 --> 00:21:06,777
I was so embarrassed that I said,

312
00:21:07,071 --> 00:21:09,258
No, I'm sorry.

313
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:13,982
I went there, and it was me no matter who saw it.

314
00:21:14,175 --> 00:21:16,916
So I want to call him.

315
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:21,249
Actually, I was Kim Chaewon.

316
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:22,761
I'm sorry.

317
00:21:23,447 --> 00:21:25,008
I was so surprised that I lied.

318
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:31,257
It caught my heart.

319
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,805
I'm sure he came with courage.

320
00:21:41,895 --> 00:21:44,606
He just left, and it hurt my heart more.

321
00:21:50,815 --> 00:21:53,696
I was right.

322
00:22:08,852 --> 00:22:12,946
These days, do you know the movie, Moonlight?

323
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:15,830
You're watching the movie again.

324
00:22:16,822 --> 00:22:19,440
I used to watch it a lot.

325
00:22:22,101 --> 00:22:22,968


326
00:22:23,481 --> 00:22:25,373
The feeling and atmosphere I saw at that time.

327
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,300
The content is really fun.

328
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,300
That's right.

329
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,300
It's really fun.

330
00:22:36,139 --> 00:22:39,096
The content is really crazy.

331
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,300
"It's really sad."

332
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:44,473
That's right. It's hard because it's sad.

333
00:22:45,376 --> 00:22:46,345


334
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,250
I'm watching it again because it's so fun.

335
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,300
"I can't sleep when I hear my sister's voice."

336
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,300
It's good, right?

337
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,300
What should I do, Ha Eun?

338
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,850
Radio or something like this.

339
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,300
No, it's because I have a voice live.

340
00:23:16,232 --> 00:23:18,585
I'll turn on the voice live often.

341
00:23:19,329 --> 00:23:21,135
I can't sleep.

342
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,300
I'll turn it on for you.

343
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:26,613
Let's count the sheep, Chae-eun.

344
00:23:26,707 --> 00:23:28,422
I don't count sheep.

345
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,760
When I can't sleep,

346
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,580
When I can't sleep,

347
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,060
I don't think I have a lot of times when I can't sleep.

348
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,100
What do I do when I can't sleep?

349
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,800
"I read books."

350
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,520
When I read books, I can't sleep.

351
00:23:54,521 --> 00:23:57,310
Is it because I keep writing my eyes?

352
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,260
Or I can't sleep when I use my phone.

353
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,260
Is it because my eyes are tired?

354
00:24:28,644 --> 00:24:30,584
Today's

355
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:49,500
I don't drink coffee that much.

356
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm lying down.

357
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,260
I'm lying down.

358
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:50,280
I'm lying down.

359
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:02,641
You're sleepy, right?

360
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,740
If you're sleepy, let's go to bed.

361
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:05,667


362
00:25:07,664 --> 00:25:10,126
You know you can sleep well when you're sleepy, right?

363
00:25:07,705 --> 00:25:10,047


364
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,334
Siro?

365
00:25:25,401 --> 00:25:26,965
He doesn't listen to me.

366
00:25:31,956 --> 00:25:34,057
He's a troublemaker.

367
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,552
I've never been bitten by him.

368
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,300
"Chaeyeon, please tell me about the combination of Yoa and Jung."

369
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,300
But I like fruit ring.

370
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,300
I like chocolate pop and chocolate shell.

371
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,738


372
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,300
Fruits ring!

373
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,300
It's delicious even if you eat it.

374
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,300
"What's going on?"

375
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,300
Oh my god.

376
00:26:36,503 --> 00:26:38,319
There's someone who's older than me.

377
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,300
Chaewon, marry me!

378
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,300
Marry me!

379
00:26:53,414 --> 00:26:56,626


380
00:26:57,193 --> 00:27:03,722


381
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,300
What's this song?

382
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,300
I'm suddenly singing this song.

383
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,300
Oh, right.

384
00:27:56,436 --> 00:27:58,669
"Chaewon, I want to see a dance challenge."

385
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:01,862
Dance challenge?

386
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:03,381


387
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,300
Chaewon, do you know that there are less than 90 days left this year?

388
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,300
"Chaewon, do you know that there are less than 90 days left this year?"

389
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,300
No way.

390
00:28:14,997 --> 00:28:17,053
Isn't time too fast?

391
00:28:21,235 --> 00:28:24,039
This year...

392
00:29:00,675 --> 00:29:03,082


393
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:44,067
Then is Eun-chae an adult, too?

394
00:29:44,586 --> 00:29:46,571
Oh my god...

395
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,080
It really is

396
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,980
Oh time is super fast

397
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,980
What I felt was...

398
00:30:20,087 --> 00:30:22,501


399
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:29,581
Among the Pianas,

400
00:30:24,203 --> 00:30:27,010


401
00:30:28,006 --> 00:30:29,626


402
00:30:30,054 --> 00:30:34,083


403
00:30:34,545 --> 00:30:36,927


404
00:30:38,492 --> 00:30:41,118


405
00:30:41,921 --> 00:30:45,120
there are Pianas that I've seen for a long time,

406
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:41,980
and there are Pianas that just came in.

407
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,980
They're all so precious and thankful.

408
00:30:46,873 --> 00:30:57,050
It's been six years since I debuted in the entertainment industry.

409
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,980
That's how long it's been.

410
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:05,980
So, from the beginning,

411
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:13,319
I've seen...

412
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,980
I've seen...

413
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,980
I've seen so many Pianas that have been supporting me.

414
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,980
I've seen so many Pianas that have been supporting me.

415
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,980
And the Pianas who have been supporting us

416
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,980
until now...

417
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,980
It was really amazing.

418
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,980
It was amazing.

419
00:31:15,991 --> 00:31:26,032
It was amazing.

420
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,980
Thank you so much.

421
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,980
It's good, right?

422
00:32:22,824 --> 00:32:32,233


423
00:32:32,413 --> 00:32:34,310


424
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,980
If we stay together for a long time,

425
00:32:35,665 --> 00:32:38,512
We're awesome.

426
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,980
If we don't have each other,

427
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,685
"Chaewon, you have to do it until you're in your 50s."

428
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,648
Oh, yes.

429
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,770
50s...

430
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,980
50 years old.

431
00:33:24,548 --> 00:33:25,532


432
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,980
I work out a lot.

433
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,105
I take good care of my nutrients.

434
00:33:31,438 --> 00:33:34,864
Until I'm in my 50s.

435
00:33:36,077 --> 00:33:38,102
I'll do my best until I'm in my 50s.

436
00:33:40,701 --> 00:33:42,775
Can I dance to Fearless again?

437
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,780
That was interesting.

438
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,980
Because maybe you it was interesting after having done it for a long time.

439
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:14,480


440
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,453


441
00:34:18,912 --> 00:34:36,642


442
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,820
Should I go to bed now?

443
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,820
"Oh, my."

444
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,820
Oh, my.

445
00:35:46,202 --> 00:35:49,996
Oh, my.

446
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,820
Oh, my.

447
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,820
Oh, my.

448
00:35:57,177 --> 00:35:59,340
Oh, my.

449
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,820
It's 12 o'clock.

450
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,820
It's 12 o'clock.

451
00:36:07,826 --> 00:36:09,820


452
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,820
It's 12 o'clock.

453
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,820
And it is next day.

454
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:46,160
Wow, that's right. It's early.

455
00:36:59,128 --> 00:37:00,872
Chaeyeon, hurry up and eat that cabbage.

456
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,914
It's not dinner yet. What kind of cabbage is it?

457
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,840
It's early in the morning.

458
00:37:14,892 --> 00:37:16,172
It's just the beginning.

459
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,780
Amechu?

460
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:11,360
Bagel.

461
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,020
Ssambap.

462
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:19,597
Ssambap.

463
00:38:20,722 --> 00:38:22,975
I can only have ssambap on my stomach right now.

464
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:26,020
London bagel looks good.

465
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,020
Nemo Nemo. Nemo Nemo.

466
00:38:34,429 --> 00:38:35,908
"I don't like bagels."

467
00:38:36,975 --> 00:38:39,575
Don't eat bagels. Then eat rice.

468
00:38:40,221 --> 00:38:42,945
You don't really like bread.

469
00:38:47,064 --> 00:38:48,739
"Recommend me the steamed bean paste flavor."

470
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:09,871
The comments are going faster.

471
00:39:20,906 --> 00:39:23,207
"What? It's greasy."

472
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,020
Thank you, Vianna.

473
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,213


474
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,411
Don't get hurt.

475
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:43,867
I'm sorry.

476
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,020
I'm sorry.

477
00:39:45,941 --> 00:39:47,359
I'm kidding.

478
00:40:10,106 --> 00:40:14,344
Then I'll go to bed now.

479
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,020
Why?

480
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:18,397
I'm really early tomorrow.

481
00:40:27,478 --> 00:40:30,335
"From now on, the person who sleeps is a fool."

482
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,006
Then I'll be a fool.

483
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,020
Let's all be fools together.

484
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:49,825


485
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,020
Let's be fools.

486
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,020
Vianna, you know what?

487
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:59,020
If you sleep now, you'll be happy tomorrow.

488
00:40:59,842 --> 00:41:07,016
You have to sleep now to sleep well and have a good condition.

489
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,020
I have no regrets tomorrow.

490
00:41:12,744 --> 00:41:14,685
Bye bye.

491
00:41:16,085 --> 00:41:17,772


492
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,020
Bye.

493
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,020
Good night.

494
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:22,814


495
00:41:23,886 --> 00:41:24,992


496
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,020
Bye bye.

497
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,606
Bye.
