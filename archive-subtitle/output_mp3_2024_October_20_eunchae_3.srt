00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
i love you

2
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:27,279
hi

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Wait a minute. I was looking at the filter.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's already in.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Is this better?

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hi.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I just...

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I just got off in Korea.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm...

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm waiting for my suitcase.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So...

12
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,869
I came to play for a moment, everyone.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I went to Japan.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's not an airport, it's my room.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Before I go to bed,

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I was lying on my bed.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I only did voice live.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
At that time, Fiona always asked me to show my face.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Today...

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's not before I go to bed yet.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
My face is ready, so I turned it on.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It got pretty cold in Korea.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
To say that...

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I've only been in Japan for a day.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I think it's the second time 50 subjects.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If it's fun, I'll go to the tank again.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm a normal baby.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Did you watch the First It'sاشmso Lobby?

30
00:02:08,096 --> 00:02:09,442


31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Why are you getting a lot of돈?

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No, no, no.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The director said after the first episode of The huge paper...

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yong.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Don't say but...

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Hmm.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Today, I was on the plane.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I usually sleep on the plane.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But today, I didn't sleep and watched the best baseball game.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's my first time watching the best baseball game.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It was so much fun.

42
00:02:50,247 --> 00:02:52,761
Almost all of them are watching the best baseball game.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
When I watched the best baseball game alone, my heart was beating so fast.

44
00:02:55,647 --> 00:02:58,648


45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I watched the best baseball game alone like this.

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I watched the best baseball game and got off the plane.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Did you really succeed in ticketing?

48
00:03:12,853 --> 00:03:16,168


49
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:25,593
When was the last time you learned Japanese?

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
When was the last time you learned Japanese?

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Today...

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I can remember.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I can remember.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
When?

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
When?

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
My hair is short.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
My eyes look tired.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
My eyes look tired?

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Why?

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Do my eyes look tired?

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Why?

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I can remember.

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I can remember.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Today...

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I can remember today.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Where is it?

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
This is my room.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Welcome to my room.

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This is my bed.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Do you want to see it?

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Ta-da.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Ta-da.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Do you know this?

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's not the lion doll that was in our first documentary.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's a lion doll with a hood.

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It popped out of here.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I pulled it like this and my eyebrows split.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What do you want to see?

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Come on.

80
00:04:54,658 --> 00:04:57,806


81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm worried about поступating.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What do you want to see?

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You talk on about what you want to see.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
How do you watch TV to influence something?

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Come again.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I watch K-POP.

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Sorry.

88
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Come.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Weeep!

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Stay safe.

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I had a good Groundhog Day this time.

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Do you miss it?

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Did you have a goodday?

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I don't have much in my room.

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Bed

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The standby I got from the Reuniverse.

97
00:05:25,907 --> 00:05:28,791


98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
TV TV TV

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Cosmetic table

100
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm sorry to introduce the room.

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm not ready yet.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Show me anything.

103
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,987


104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
My room

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
There's a computer right next to the bed.

106
00:06:07,151 --> 00:06:10,397


107
00:06:10,464 --> 00:06:14,287


108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
When I lived in Overwatch,

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I didn't want to live without this computer.

110
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,066
I don't play games now.

111
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So I'm just using it as a desk.

112
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,920


113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Did you cut your hair today?

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I untied it.

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Please say it in Japanese.

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Kyou

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Kyou mo

119
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Nihon

120
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Kyou mo

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Did you see it in Japanese?

122
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I didn't know.

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:16,940
Love

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,640
I'm

125
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,640
Like it works..

126
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,980
Anyway

127
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,700
Today's TMI

128
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,140
I cut iron 님's bangs

129
00:07:36,846 --> 00:07:38,018


130
00:07:39,872 --> 00:07:41,037


131
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,720
"Am I good at Japanese?"

132
00:07:44,692 --> 00:07:47,133


133
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,640
It's perfect night. Thank you. Perfect night.

134
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:58,640
Perfect night.

135
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,640
Perfect night tonight.

136
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,640
I don't care what's wrong.

137
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,640
I don't care what's wrong.

138
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,640
Perfect night tonight.

139
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,640
I don't care what's wrong or right.

140
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,640
Please don't phone me no more.

141
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,400
There is an English class tomorrow.

142
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,280
Where will I go?

143
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
Fighting!

144
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,340
Fighting!

145
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:36,640
There is an exam tomorrow.

146
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,640
weightless

147
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,640
What are you talking about?

148
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,640
Capture time!

149
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,640
Capture time?

150
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,640
Since the camera is on, let's capture time

151
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,640
How should I do it? Capture time

152
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,640
Wink

153
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,640
Wink and read the comments

154
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,640
Wink and read the comments

155
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,640
Wink

156
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,640
I think my wink skills have decreased

157
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,640
Why do my eyes look closed?

158
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,640
Right?

159
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,640
I can do it

160
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,640
But I can't do it prettily

161
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,640
Wink

162
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,640
I don't like it
