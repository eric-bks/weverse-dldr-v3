00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hi, FEARNOT

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
FEARNOT, gather around

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
FEARNOT, gather around

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
FEARNOT, gather around

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Where did ZUHA go?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
ZUHA? ZUHA is here

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
ZUHA is here

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
ZUHA is here

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
FEARNOT

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let me go

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let me go

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I was wrong

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hi

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What was that?

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I haven't asked yet

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What was that?

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
FEARNOT, it was our last show

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It was our last show

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It was our last show today

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You didn't know, right?

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Our last show

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We want it

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'll take a picture

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll take a picture

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Don't look

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thank you

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Thank you

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I can't say anything

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Congrats

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Last show

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Last show

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This time

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I think

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I think

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We played well

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We played well

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Why?

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We played well

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We went to the US

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Because we all went to New York together.

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That's right.

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
There's that too.

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Mission positive.

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Ah, MICHIN(positive).

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
MICHIN(positive).

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah.

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It was so MICHIN(positive).

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So MICHIN(positive).

49
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But I think we went there really fast.

50
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Really.

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It was Friday.

52
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Ah, right.

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's right.

54
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So if we count it as one week, it's almost two weeks.

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's right.

56
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's right.

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Actually,

58
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But actually,

59
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's right.

60
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That's right.

61
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's a joke.

62
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It was short.

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But you guys wanted to see it a lot.

64
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That's right.

65
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's sad, but well..

66
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
There's no need to be sad.

67
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We'll see it someday.

68
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So,

69
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'll show it someday.

70
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Of course.

71
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Of course.

72
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Don't you think so too, FEARNOT?

73
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
FEARNOT also thinks about it now.

74
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Someday we'll go.

75
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I mean, you guys know what it's like.

76
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Now,

77
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Ah, this song...

78
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Ah, you sang it back then.

79
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Ya.

80
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This song is definitely,

81
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
this.

82
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And we read it.

83
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Since it's our last show today,

84
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
we're going to put something on our feet.

85
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We didn't do it right now, but...

86
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
During the music show,

87
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
we put something on our feet.

88
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That is...

89
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
HOT.

90
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That is...

91
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Lightning.

92
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That is...

93
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That is...

94
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Our hearts.

95
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Our hearts.

96
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Our hearts.

97
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
This crazy...

98
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Hearts.

99
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This crazy positive three weeks.

100
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Hearts.

101
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Three weeks.

102
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Thank you for being with us for three weeks.

103
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Our love.

104
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Did you enjoy it?

105
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What?

106
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Really?

107
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This?

108
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yes.

109
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's it.

110
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We...

112
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Thank you.

113
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What did you just say?

114
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
No.

115
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What did you say?

116
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What did you say?

117
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
When did you pass?

118
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
When it passed,

119
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
we played VLIVE in the same background in New York.

120
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
When did it pass?

121
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Now?

122
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
When?

123
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
When...

124
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It passed.

125
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Before we met each other.

126
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It passed like this?

127
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes.

128
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It really passed.

129
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
About this time.

130
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You said you don't remember.

131
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Five of us sat down here and played VLIVE.

132
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes.

133
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Let's do it again.

134
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Let's do it again.

135
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We played VLIVE in the U.S.?

136
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No.

137
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Was it in the U.S.?

138
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Before Dishonored West came,

139
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Dishonored West?

140
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Oh, right!

141
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It was Dishonored West!

142
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's right!

143
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
When we entered, we kept saying hello to the FEARNOT.

144
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't remember.

145
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You must have been very nervous.

146
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
No, the three of us were more nervous.

147
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I was fine.

148
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I fainted after it was over.

149
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I remember early.

150
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It was a really busy day.

151
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It was probably the busiest day of the three days.

152
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Was it the first day?

153
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It was the first day.

154
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Why?

155
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I couldn't wait.

156
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Between schedules,

157
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
the time was a little empty.

158
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But I was lying on the floor for a minute.

159
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I can't do it.

160
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
5 minutes?

161
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But I had to do it right away.

162
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Hi!

163
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It was really new.

164
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's so funny.

165
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
How did that happen?

166
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
There was about 5 minutes.

167
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I couldn't sleep.

168
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I couldn't do it.

169
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I couldn't do it.

170
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
As soon as I lay down,

171
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I said,

172
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Hi!

173
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Nice to meet you.

174
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I can't do it.

175
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What should I do?

176
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What should I do?

177
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What should I do?

178
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
There's nothing to do like this.

179
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I don't have much time.

180
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I was the first person to ask

181
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Really, everyone.

182
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Thank you so much for the votes.

183
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Thank you so much.

184
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This was a special vote.

185
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's a real vote.

186
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Thank you for the votes.

187
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Me?

188
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Thank you!

189
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Thank you!

190
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The voting was very special.

191
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,700
Right, and we always post our proof shots too.

192
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,400
The two of us are like this.

193
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,700
We're like, you voted? You voted? We voted for you.

194
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,600
That kind of atmosphere is so...

195
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,800
Cute and lovely. Thank you so much.

196
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,300
It was so much fun.

197
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,300
It was a great week.

198
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,800
It was really fun.

199
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Wow.

200
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,200
There were a lot of things that happened in these three weeks.

201
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,600
We didn't have a lot of fans, but...

202
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,100
What was it? M Countdown and...

203
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,300
Right, M Countdown.

204
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,500
Right.

205
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Thank you.

206
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,000
But we didn't have any fans.

207
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But we didn't have any fans.

208
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,100
How do you feel?

209
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,300
How do I feel?

210
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,800
How do I feel?

211
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,700
How do I feel?

212
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,000
Actually, the first place is...

213
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,900
LESSERAFIM!

214
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,900
LESSERAFIM!

215
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,300
Yes, thanks to FEARNOT,

216
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,500
we were able to have a great time.

217
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,900
Thanks to FEARNOT,

218
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,600
FEARNOT is crazy!

219
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,700
Right?

220
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,500
Yes.

221
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,000
Crazy?

222
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,700
FEARNOT is crazy!

223
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,900
Did you believe it?

224
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,500
Thank you.

225
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,200
Thank you.

226
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,000
Thank you.

227
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Thanks to FEARNOT,

228
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
we had a lot of unbelievable moments.

229
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,600
Thank you so much.

230
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,000
We'll do our best and show you a good performance.

231
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,600
We'll make you happy.

232
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,800
We'll make you happy.

233
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,100
And our SOURCE MUSIC!

234
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,000
Thank you.

235
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,100
Thank you so much.

236
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,000
SOURCE!

237
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,400
All the staff worked really hard.

238
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,500
Yeah, right.

239
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,300
For our team...

240
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,800
For MSM...

241
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,300
Right.

242
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,000
The three of you worked really hard.

243
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,100
MS was so pretty this time.

244
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,000
She's crazy!

245
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,500
She's crazy!

246
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,000
It was a crazy positive!

247
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,300
It was a crazy positive!

248
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,600
A crazy positive!

249
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
Thank you so much.

250
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Yes.

251
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,500
Yes.

252
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
It's a great award.

253
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,400
Yes.

254
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,900
Thank you, members.

255
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,500
Yes, yes.

256
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,600
The members are working hard too.

257
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,800
You all worked hard.

258
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,100
You all worked hard.

259
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,800
Isn't that it?

260
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,300
It is.

261
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,300
It's a little bit...

262
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,200
It's a little bit...

263
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
I'm going to go up there.

264
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Visualizer? Visualizer?

265
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Right, right, right. That's really funny.

266
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Oh, what's that?

267
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
That's really funny.

268
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
But in the middle, it's so funny that she's wearing clothes.

269
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
It's the same.

270
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
It's the same color as the chroma key.

271
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
It's the same color as the chroma key.

272
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
What's that? I don't know.

273
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
I don't know.

274
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
I was just going to do it.

275
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
So I pretended to wear it.

276
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
But it came out so well.

277
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
It came out the same as the picture.

278
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
But it was so much fun.

279
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
It was so real.

280
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Thank you.

281
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
I keep watching it even though there's nothing.

282
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
It's so funny.

283
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
Is it all out now?

284
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,400
Now...

285
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,400
It came out at 6 o'clock today.

286
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Call Me On Zero.

287
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
That's right.

288
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,400
I took it a long time ago.

289
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,400
I took it a long time ago.

290
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
Sunny doesn't come out.

291
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
I took it a long time ago.

292
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,400
I took it a long time ago.

293
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
I took it a long time ago.

294
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
I'm curious.

295
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,400
What kind of concept did you like the most?

296
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
What kind of concept did you like the most?

297
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
For me...

298
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
It's hard.

299
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
It's really hard.

300
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
It's hard, but...

301
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
It's hard, but...

302
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,400
The stage was fun.

303
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
VMA

304
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
VMA

305
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
The FEARNOT was amazing.

306
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,400
The FEARNOT was amazing.

307
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
No, I never had a pre-recording with FEARNOT so close.

308
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
No, I never had a pre-recording with FEARNOT so close.

309
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
I felt the energy from the bottom of my heart.

310
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,400
I felt the energy from the top of my heart.

311
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
I felt the energy from the top of my heart.

312
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
I was so touched.

313
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
The youngest members...

314
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,400
There's another world here.

315
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
We're in another world.

316
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
It's hidden in the middle.

317
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,400
It's hidden in the middle.

318
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
It's in the middle.

319
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
The lights are perfect.

320
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
V, V!

321
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,400
V

322
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
V, you have to be quiet.

323
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Even if you're doing a V,

324
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Even if I go this way,

325
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
I go this way.

326
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
It's really hard.

327
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
I hope you do well.

328
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,400
How did you do it?

329
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
EUNCHAE, are you okay?

330
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,400
EUNCHAE, you try it.

331
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
EUNCHAE, you're good at this.

332
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
She's really good at this.

333
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
No, no.

334
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,400
No, that's not it.

335
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,400
No, no.

336
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
What was it?

337
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Start!

338
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
No, no.

339
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,400
It didn't come out like that.

340
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,400
It came out really well.

341
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
I'll do it again.

342
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,400
I'm sorry.

343
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
I'm sorry.

344
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
MICHIN(positive)

345
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Right, right.

346
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
It's the same.

347
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
We did weverse live in the practice room.

348
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Right.

349
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
It was during the promotion.

350
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
I was surprised to hear that.

351
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
I was surprised to hear that.

352
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,400
But it was really effective.

353
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
FEARNOT and LESSERAFIM must be together.

354
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
FEARNOT and LESSERAFIM must be together.

355
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
There's a lot of support.

356
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
That's right.

357
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
We won't do that.

358
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,660
We will do it with Weverse Live

359
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,660
We will do it with Weverse Live

360
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,060
Let's do it like that from now on

361
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,060
Then we will do it next time

362
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,060
Yes

363
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,320
From Chuseok

364
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,900
Have a good Chuseok

365
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,660
That's right

366
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,660
Chuseok

367
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,020
It's Chuseok holiday

368
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,820
Drive safely

369
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,920
Eat a lot of delicious food

370
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,540
I hope you come back safely

371
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,760
Yes

372
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,420
Stay healthy

373
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,160
Thank you, FEARNOT

374
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
Thank you so much for this promotion

375
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
Thank you so much

376
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,420
Thank you so much, FEARNOT

377
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,420
Thank you so much

378
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,380
We have the end of the year

379
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,720
Let's cheer up until the end of this year

380
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,020
Let's cheer up

381
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,020
Bye bye
