1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Are you okay?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Here we go again, okay.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is...

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
These are glasses that I've never worn outside.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Okay, wait.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is a good part.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This too.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
These are my glasses.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This is so cool,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
but it hurts when I wear it.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Because I can't see it well.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
There's a delay.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm going crazy.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The sync doesn't work because I'm going crazy?

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The sync doesn't work?

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What's going on?

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Really?

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,800
Hold on.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm going crazy.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm going crazy.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm going crazy.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm going crazy.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The place you can go.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Really?

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
No.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
No?

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Is it cut?

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Oh, my God.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Really?

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Can't you hear the sound?

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Can't you hear the sound?

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What's wrong with you?

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I can't even put it in color.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay. End.
