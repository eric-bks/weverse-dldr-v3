ENG TRANS & JLML718

2
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,660
Hi!

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,580
It's me.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,560
Observing Alex's voice

5
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,660
Come on in

6
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:46,860
Mmm, it's good

7
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,900
Let me turn the music on

8
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,260
What am I playing?

9
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:59,100
Won't it work?

10
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,000
Wait

11
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,240
This is not my ID, so I'll change it to my ID

12
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,240
I'm going to change it to my ID.

13
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,240
Hello.

14
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,240
Siwoo is so cute, right?

15
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,240
So cute.

16
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,240
As soon as I saw the shoes,

17
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,240
they were so cute.

18
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,240
It was a shock.

19
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,240
Crocs are this small.

20
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,240
So Siwoo can wear them.

21
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,240
I'm going to change it to my ID.

22
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,240
I'm going to change it to my ID.

23
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,240
I'm done.

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,240
Okay.

25
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,240
What's that face?

26
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,240
What's that face?

27
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,240
What's that face?

28
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,240
I don't know.

29
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,240
Is it 3 a.m. in America?

30
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Oh my god.

31
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,240
3 a.m.?

32
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,240
Isn't it too early?

33
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,240
Isn't it too early?

34
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,240
What song should I play?

35
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,240
What song should I play?

36
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,240
I'll play my favorite song.

37
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,240
I'll play my favorite song.

38
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,240
All right, here we go.

39
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,240
All right, here we go.

40
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,240
Excuse me.

41
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,240
Excuse me.

42
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,240
Excuse me.

43
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,240
Excuse me.

44
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,240
Excuse me.

45
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,240
Excuse me.

46
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,240
Excuse me.

47
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,240
Excuse me.

48
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,240
Excuse me.

49
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,240
Excuse me.

50
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,240
Excuse me.

51
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,240
I got it done, but it looks like a flower.

52
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,240
It's a bit like a year-old.

53
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,240
My hair doesn't tie. Look at this.

54
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,240
When are you going to grow it?

55
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Are you bored again today?

56
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,240
Yes, that's right.

57
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,240
Wait a minute. I want to tie my hair, but my hair comes out like this.

58
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,240
I'm going to force it to tie it up.

59
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,240
First

60
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,240
Cut the wood?

61
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
Do you want to die?

62
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,240
What should I do?

63
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,240
It's so different.

64
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,240
You know what a summer rock is, right?

65
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,240
When you tie it up like this,

66
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,240
You know it tastes good, right?

67
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,240
Do you know what it is?

68
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
I like it.

69
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,240
I'll do it like this.

70
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,240
This is my favorite jelly these days.

71
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
It's crazy. This is so delicious.

72
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
Should I cover it?

73
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,240
I don't know why these days.

74
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,240
It's been a while since I heard the sound of a rock.

75
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
I've been hearing it's the best.

76
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,240
It's a live video, so there's a clapping sound.

77
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,240
Can you hear the piano?

78
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,240
Hello.

79
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,240
This is really good.

80
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,240
There's a more delicious jelly that's like the lizard jelly.

81
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,240
Is it perfect?

82
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,240
Okay, I'm going to go now.

83
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,240
I'm going to go now.

84
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,240
Is it perfect?

85
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Okay, I've got the hang of it now.

86
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
I feel good.

87
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
What should I do?

88
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,240
Show me the outfit of your mind.

89
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,240
Okay.

90
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,240
Today's outfit is...

91
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,240
Ta-da.

92
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,240
Just like this.

93
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,240
It's time to wear my clothes.

94
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,240
I have to go around like this.

95
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,240
For this fall.

96
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,240
I bought this jacket.

97
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,240
How is it? Isn't it pretty?

98
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,240
What should I wear?

99
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,240
I'll take it off like this.

100
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:36,660
📞

101
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,740
Where's your pose...

102
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,240
What should I wear?

103
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,240
It was my effort.

104
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,240
I wanted to show you my hard work.

105
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,240
Wait, the person who's playing the music

106
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,240
is not playing the music right now.

107
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,240
If you suddenly introduce your clothes,

108
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
what are you going to do?

109
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,240
I'll play you my playlist.

110
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
Let's start.

111
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,240
Trust me.

112
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,240
If you freeze it, it tastes better.

113
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
Freeze what? This jelly?

114
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
This?

115
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,240
Freeze it?

116
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Then how do you chew it?

117
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,240
What kind of schedule did you have today?

118
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
I just filmed it.

119
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,240
You know I can't tell you.

120
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,240
I just took a pretty picture and took a pretty video.

121
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
I just took a pretty picture and took a pretty video.

122
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,240
I just took a pretty picture and took a pretty video.

123
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,240
It ended earlier than I thought.

124
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
It's been a long time since I've done this.

125
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,240
It's been a long time since I've done this.

126
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
It's been a long time since I've done this.

127
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
It ended earlier than I expected.

128
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
It ended earlier than I expected.

129
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
I was so happy.

130
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
I finished early.

131
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
I finished early.

132
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
I finished early.

133
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,240
I finished early.

134
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,240
The picture quality is so good right now.

135
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,240
The picture quality is so good right now.

136
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,240
The picture quality is so good right now.

137
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,240
Isn't it good?

138
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
Is it not working?

139
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
It's not working right now.

140
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
It's not working?

141
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
It won't work.

142
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,740
There's me who put me in

143
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,040
So I'm ready to journey again

144
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,240
Even if I leave here and change

145
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,540
Deep in my heart, in my small island

146
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,740
There's me who put me in

147
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,240
So I'm ready to journey again

148
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,240
It's okay now

149
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,440
Really? It keeps breaking

150
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,740
It doesn't make sense

151
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,040
Make a band song!

152
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,540
I really like band songs

153
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,340
Don't you think you know what I mean?

154
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,540
When I recommend a song

155
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,940
I recommend that kind of song a lot

156
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,340
I really like band songs

157
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,140
I want to try it someday

158
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,240
But it's breaking?

159
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,640
Why is it breaking?

160
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,140
Is it because it's underground?

161
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,140
Did you get the song request?

162
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,940
Yes, I got it

163
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,740
I really really got it

164
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,140
Please give me a beer

165
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,140
It's really me

166
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,640
I really got a beer

167
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,440
I'm so hungry right now

168
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,640
Let's think together

169
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,440
What should I eat for dinner?

170
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,240
What should I eat for dinner today?

171
00:12:36,240 --> 00:13:02,340
Folks

172
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:11,440
I want to eat soup like this.

173
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
But it's almost 8 o'clock.

174
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,440
I'm so...

175
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:23,440
But Looniverse is important.

176
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,440
I don't have much time.

177
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,440
It's always my plan.

178
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,440
I'm on a OLED TV set.

179
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:42,440
The stage is good.

180
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,100
I

181
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,440
I don't know.

182
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,440
Don't you prepare anything?

183
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,440
You need to work hard.

184
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,440
I think these music videos are easy to make classes.

185
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,440
Let's いみ

186
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
All right.

187
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,440
All right.

188
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:09,440
It's raining all day

189
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:17,440
I can't breathe

190
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:26,440
Oh I'm drowning

191
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:33,440
You're taking my heart

192
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,440
Really, I'm honestly just sad about my shoes

193
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:03,440
You're taking my heart

194
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,440
I like to dance when I party

195
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,440
I like to kiss everybody

196
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
Where the heck is Saki?

197
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
She's waiting down in the lobby

198
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
I'm trying to break it down, yeah baby yeah

199
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
Turn up the party

200
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,440
I like to dance when I party

201
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,440
I like to dance when I party

202
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,440
I like to dance when I party

203
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,440
I like to dance when I party

204
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,440
I like to dance when I party

205
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,440
I like to dance when I party

206
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
I'm trying to break it down, yeah baby yeah

207
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,440
Turn up the party

208
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,440
Run it back, yeah, I like this track

209
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
Drop it, drop it back

Let's get, break it down, girl

213
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
I bet you can get past me

214
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,440
Hopae, sweet angel, I'm so good

215
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,440
I'm so nerdy, so sassy

216
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,440
Oh shit, oh my god

217
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,440
DJ play my favorite song

218
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,440
Raise the roof, let the dogs

219
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,440
I played something by Beyonce

220
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,440
I'm not trying to leave until they kick us to the rock

221
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
What's this?

222
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,000
There's a flat scene of kimchi jjim and a spam chun.

223
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,440
I've learned this.

224
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,440
I really like the hair I just tied up.

225
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,440
I think I know what this is.

226
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,440
If you tie it up again, it won't be tied up like this.

227
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,440
If you tie it up again, it won't be tied up like this.

228
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,440
If you tie it up again, it won't be tied up like this.

229
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,440
No, we have two minutes left.

230
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,440
No, we have two minutes left.

231
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
Bagel cream cheese looks delicious.

232
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,440
Oh, my God.

233
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
I'll show you the video with you, not confident.

234
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
After choosing the set of the outfit, I should take a break and go shopping.

235
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,440
But I came on the side.

236
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,440
I don't know anything.

237
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,440
Her love is no joke.

238
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,440
So please look at the other side too.

239
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,440
It's too hard to see.

240
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,440
el 2000

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,440

So where my, where my girls at

00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,840
Where my, where my boys at

247
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,340
Let's have a cup of coffee together

248
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,840
We're just like a man and a woman

249
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,240
Three of us, three of us, three of us, three of us, three of us

250
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,540
I'm so hungry right now

251
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,340
I want to recommend you something and eat it all

252
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,340
That's my girl

253
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,340
Like mine, like mine, like mine

254
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,340
That's my girl

255
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,540
Today is my day and night

256
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,540
That's my girl

257
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,940
We're just like two of us

258
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,540
Let's listen to our calm song

259
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,940
I'll sing a calm song

260
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,940
I honestly just sat on my shoes

261
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,940
I'll sing a calm song

262
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,440
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

263
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,440
I don't know why, but I feel like I'm in the middle of a dream.

264
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
I'm sorry.

265
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,440
Why are you crying when you're in the academy?

266
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
It's good, but it's sad.

267
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,440
I'm sorry.

268
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
The timing wasn't right.

269
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
I'm sorry.

270
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,440
I'm sorry.

271
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
I'm sorry.

272
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,440
I'm sorry.

273
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
I'm sorry.

274
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
I'm sorry.

275
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,440
What's in your bag?

276
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,440
I don't have anything in my bag.

277
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
What's in my bag today?

278
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,440
Just take a selfie for me today.

279
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
I will ask.

280
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
I will ask.

281
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,440
The title of the song is

282
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
I Left My Heart.

283
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,740
She's waiting for me cause she knows that we need each other

284
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:32,940
I know we feel shy after no hurry

285
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:38,040
But that's just how she told me goodbyes

286
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,940
No doubt we were crazy when she's waiting for me

287
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,440
And I wish I could be there tonight

288
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,940
Oh I wish I could be there tonight

289
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,440
I miss the faces and I watch the stories

290
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,440
From strangers that feel just like home

291
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,940
I use the same old one-liners you taught me

292
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,940
While drinking until the bar closed

293
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,940
But now when I go home I'm sleepin' in the desert

294
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,940
I miss the faces and I watch the stories from strangers that feel just like home

295
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,440
I miss the faces and I watch the stories from strangers that feel just like home

296
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,440
I miss the faces and I watch the stories from strangers that feel just like home

297
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,440
What was it?

298
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,440
Not these days

299
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,440
Not these days

300
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,440
Not these days

301
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
I started watching it today

302
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:37,440
The one with Lee Seyoung and the one after the love story

303
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,440
That one

304
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,440
I watched it

305
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,440
I watched it

306
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,940
I watched it

307
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:51,940
You were excellent

308
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,440
What would you like to do when you grow up?

309
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,740
I'll slowly learn

310
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,940
What would you like to do when you grow up?

311
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,740
I want to use Japanese

312
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,940
To improve

313
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,940
To improve

314
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,440
To improve

315
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:14,940
And I want to learn Japanese

316
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,940
Let's watch LUNIVERSE together.

317
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:22,940
I want to watch it together, but I'm so hungry.

318
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,940
I'm so hungry.

319
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,940
I have to go eat.

320
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,440
Now I'm so hungry.

321
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,440
I have to eat.

322
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,440
V.

323
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,440
V.

324
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
V.

325
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,440
V.

326
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,440
V.

327
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
V.

328
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
V.

329
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,440
V.

330
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,440
V.

331
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,440
Half of it? I want to do it for a long time, but live...

332
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,440
Really...

333
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
I think it's the last song.

334
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,440
I found a really good song among Yena's songs.

335
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,440
There's a Yena song called,

336
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,440
It was so good.

337
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
It was so good.

338
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,440
Oh, that was love.

339
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,440
Right?

340
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,440
It was so good.

341
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,440
Oh, that's right.

342
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,440
Why did I take my shoes to the basement today?

343
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,440
I think it'll come out.

344
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,440
It was fun.

345
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,440
Oh, should I say it?

346
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,440
The family came out.

347
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,440
It was fun.

348
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,440
It was really hot then, everyone.

349
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,440
I went there when it was really hot.

350
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,440
There's one minute left.

351
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,440
Hyeyeon, it's about time.

352
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:23,440
Bye, everyone.

353
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,440
Hi.

354
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
Bye.

355
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,440
Hi.

356
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,440
Hey.

357
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,440
Hey.

358
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,440
Bye, see you at LENIVERSE!

359
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,440
What?

360

Bye, see you at LENIVERSE!
