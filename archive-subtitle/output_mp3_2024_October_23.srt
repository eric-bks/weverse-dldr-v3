1
00:00:17,593 --> 00:00:18,660
hi

2
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,820
it's me

3
00:00:38,187 --> 00:00:39,647
Hi.

4
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:45,006
Hurry up and come in.

5
00:00:45,973 --> 00:00:46,953
Delicious.

6
00:00:48,546 --> 00:00:50,426
I should play a song.

7
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,519
What should I play?

8
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:00,626
How do I do this?

9
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:15,933
Wait

10
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:19,493
This is not my ID

11
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:21,561
I'll change it to my ID

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hello

13
00:01:28,315 --> 00:01:30,000
"Siwoo is so cute"

14
00:01:31,017 --> 00:01:32,276
So cute

15
00:01:33,057 --> 00:01:35,000
As soon as I saw the shoes

16
00:01:35,652 --> 00:01:38,000
I was shocked because they were so cute

17
00:01:38,562 --> 00:01:41,000
Crocs are this small

18
00:01:41,547 --> 00:01:43,000
So Siwoo can wear them

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,920
What was the password?

20
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,300
I did it

21
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:11,267
Okay

22
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,437
What is this face?

23
00:02:23,657 --> 00:02:25,461
Please do this face

24
00:02:25,894 --> 00:02:27,665
What is this face?

25
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,000
Is it 3 a.m. in America?

26
00:02:46,932 --> 00:02:47,932
Oh my god

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
3 a.m.?

28
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,440
Isn't it too late?

29
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:02,799


30
00:03:04,821 --> 00:03:06,661


31
00:03:10,294 --> 00:03:11,774


32
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:21,098


33
00:03:22,547 --> 00:03:40,928
LUNIVERSE will be released at 8pm, so I'll turn it off before that because I have to focus on LUNIVERSE.

34
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:53,000
It's not black hair. I just toned it down, but it looks like black hair.

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's a little bit like an old-fashioned color.

36
00:04:01,704 --> 00:04:03,384


37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,932
My hair doesn't tie. Look at this.

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What should I do? When will it grow?

39
00:04:14,235 --> 00:04:16,000
"Are you here because you're bored again today?"

40
00:04:16,068 --> 00:04:17,000
Yes, that's right.

41
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:18,433
Thank you.

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Wait a minute. I want to tie my hair, but my hair doesn't come out like this.

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,275
I'll force you to tie it up.

44
00:04:36,998 --> 00:04:38,605
The first

45
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'll cut the wood.

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Do you want to die?

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
How do you cut it?

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
How do you cut it?

49
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Like this?

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,932
You know what a summer rock is, right?

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh, but because of this.

52
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
When you tie it up like this,

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,929
You know that taste, right?

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,890
You know that taste, right?

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,932
You know that taste, right?

56
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You know that taste, right?

57
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Like this.

58
00:05:13,077 --> 00:05:14,932
Do you know what this is?

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Oh! I like it.

60
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I like it!

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll do it like this.

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's my favorite jelly these days.

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's really crazy. It's so delicious.

64
00:05:26,068 --> 00:05:27,595
Do I have to cover it?

65
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:50,474
It's a live video, so there's a clapping sound.

66
00:05:50,727 --> 00:05:52,503
Can you hear the piano?

67
00:05:54,148 --> 00:05:55,466
Hello.

68
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,736
This is really good.

69
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:03,332
There's a more delicious jelly left after the lizard jelly.

70
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,224
It's really good.

71
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,877
Is it just right?

72
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:12,951
Okay, I've got a good feeling now.

73
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:24,474
I feel good.

74
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:31,930


75
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:37,577
"Show me your mind."

76
00:06:37,645 --> 00:06:41,208
My outfit today.

77
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,507
Ta-da.

78
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,932
Just like this.

79
00:06:49,396 --> 00:06:52,000
It's time to get dressed, everyone.

80
00:06:52,547 --> 00:06:55,000
I have to wear like this.

81
00:06:56,037 --> 00:06:58,000
For this fall.

82
00:06:58,827 --> 00:07:01,492
I bought this jacket.

83
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
How is it? Isn't it pretty?

84
00:07:11,118 --> 00:07:13,118
Like this

85
00:07:21,338 --> 00:07:22,751


86
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,959
I can't see my face

87
00:07:35,962 --> 00:07:37,388
My posture

88
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:40,010
was my effort

89
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,797
I wanted to show it to you

90
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:44,419
I wanted to show it to you

91
00:07:44,487 --> 00:07:46,767
The person who plays the song

92
00:07:46,835 --> 00:07:49,161
is not playing the song

93
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:53,445
If you suddenly introduce the clothes

94
00:07:53,513 --> 00:07:55,513
Seyeon

95
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:06,590
I'll play my playlist

96
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,750
"If you freeze it, it's more delicious."

97
00:08:40,818 --> 00:08:41,550
What are you doing?

98
00:08:41,618 --> 00:08:42,483
This jelly?

99
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,451
This?

100
00:08:45,924 --> 00:08:47,231
You're going to freeze it?

101
00:08:50,918 --> 00:08:52,728
Then how do you chew it?

102
00:08:54,485 --> 00:08:55,864
"What kind of schedule did you have today?"

103
00:08:55,932 --> 00:08:56,387
Today...

104
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,839
You know I can't tell you.

105
00:09:01,907 --> 00:09:03,907
You know I can't tell you.

106
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:11,030
Just take a pretty picture.

107
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:15,131


108
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:18,857


109
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:41,062


110
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,596


111
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,932


112
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:51,734
I went straight to Music Book and did Live.

113
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
This is the first time I've seen this kind of music video in a long time, so I'm looking forward to it.

114
00:10:29,603 --> 00:10:32,475
Looking at the music video, you're looking at the music video instead of me?

115
00:11:29,811 --> 00:11:31,131
"I really like band songs."

116
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,397
Don't you think you know what I mean?

117
00:11:33,465 --> 00:11:34,796
When I recommend a song,

118
00:11:34,864 --> 00:11:36,132
I recommend that kind of song.

119
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,599


120
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:41,215
I really like it.

121
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,286


122
00:11:44,623 --> 00:11:45,630


123
00:11:46,507 --> 00:11:48,400


124
00:11:49,103 --> 00:11:50,883


125
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,580
I want to try it someday.

126
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,244
I want to try it someday.

127
00:11:59,474 --> 00:12:00,867
It's getting cut off?

128
00:12:00,935 --> 00:12:02,415
Oh my.

129
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:04,606
Why is it getting cut off?

130
00:12:04,674 --> 00:12:05,746
Is it because it's underground?

131
00:12:06,152 --> 00:12:08,152
"Do I get a request?" Yes, I do.

132
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,920
I totally get it.

133
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:15,506
I really like the song.

134
00:12:16,706 --> 00:12:18,004
I really like it.

135
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:20,601
I really like it.

136
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:22,096
I'm so hungry.

137
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:25,374
Let's think together.

138
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:27,792
What should we eat for dinner?

139
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:29,827
What should we eat for dinner?

140
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,520
Next song.

141
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Spicy which makes my stomach'll unusual panic.

142
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Spicy which makes my stomach'll unusual panic.

143
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Spicy with a familiar odor.

144
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Spicy with a familiar odor.

145
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I really like it.

146
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I really like it.

147
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I really like it.

148
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I want to eat soup and such.

149
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But the time ring still becomes 8 p. m.

150
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
it's the right moment.

151
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:28,500
I fell in love again

152
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:34,520
As boring as it gets

153
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:39,540
It rained all day before

154
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:45,180
You were filled up to the end

155
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:50,940
The night when I was out of breath

156
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,720
The words that hold my heart

157
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,520
Deeper and deeper

158
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:05,820
Oh I'm down and it's raining on

159
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:17,340
Take it, I can't breathe

160
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:27,260
Oh I'm down and it's raining on

161
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:35,260
Take it, I'm down and it's raining on

162
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:35,800
Do you want to listen to our song?

163
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,800
Miss Lafim's

164
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
1-800-HOT-AND-FUN

165
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
1-800-HOT-AND-FUN

166
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,800
I really like this song

167
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
It's my song but I love it

168
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
It's my song but I love it

169
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:15,800
1-800-HOT-AND-FUN

170
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,800
2-800-HOT-AND-FUN

171
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,800
2-800-HOT-AND-FUN

172
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,800
2-800-HOT-AND-FUN

173
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:33,800
2-800-HOT-AND-FUN

174
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,100
Drop it, drop it back

175
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,200
Louis V background

176
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,100
My night view, yeah

177
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,600
Cause I'm so classy

178
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,200
I still break it down though

179
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,900
I bet you can get past me

180
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,100
Hot place, we angel

181
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,600
I'm so cute, I'm so nerdy, so sassy

182
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,400
Oh shit, oh my god

183
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,200
DJ play my favorite song

184
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,000
Raise the roof, let the dogs

185
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,200
I play something by Beyonce

186
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,300
I'm not trying to leave until they kick us to the road

187
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,800
It's a flat scene and a spin-tune of Kimchi-jjim

188
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,700
I like to dance and I party

189
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,900
I like to kiss everybody

190
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,500
Where the heck is Saki?

191
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,300
She's waiting down in the lobby

192
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,300
I'm trying to break it down, yeah baby

193
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:11,800
Get it, get it, get it, get it

194
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,800
Turn up the party

195
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,800
I like to dance and I party

196
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,000
But I've never been to a party

197
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
I like to kiss everybody

198
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,400
Actually, I had kissing people

199
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,800
I learned this

200
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,800
I can tell you baby

201
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,100
Get it, turn up the party

202
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,300
1-800-HOT & FINE

203
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,200
That's my number, hit my line

204
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,800
1-800-HOT & FINE

205
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,500
Feel my rhythm every time

206
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,200
1-800-HOT & FINE

207
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,700
I really like this hair tied up so roughly, Gaeun

208
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
You'll see what this is

209
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,900
If you tie it up again, it won't get tied?

210
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,400
Lift it up, dog

211
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,000
Say something by Beyonce

212
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,200
I'm not trying to leave until they kick us to the road

213
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,500
But it doesn't matter, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, I'm flyin' like the wind in my pants

214
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:02,600
But it doesn't matter, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, I'm flyin' like the wind in my pants

215
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,720
They do what's cool, don't get it, never see my phone

216
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,180
I like to dance with a party

217
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,620
I like to kiss everybody

218
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,100
Where the heck is Saki?

219
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,140
She's waiting down in the lobby

220
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,080
I'm trying to break it down, yeah baby

221
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,820
Get it, turn up the party

222
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,280
I like to dance with a party

223
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,720
I like to kiss everybody

224
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,220
Where the heck is Saki?

225
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,880
She's waiting down in the lobby

226
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,000
No, we have a little bit left.

227
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Baby, get it, turn up the party

228
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,420
Bagel and cream cheese looks good.

229
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,120
Oh my gosh.

230
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Let's just do it cause it's fun

231
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,760
I'm running around with my focus tied up

232
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,880
After the same day

233
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,980
They say whoa whoa, I'll bite it later and work

234
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,180
I want to wake up in my quiet heart

235
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,180
Good girl, I'll be a doll

236
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,860
So be town man, like a balloon

237
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,420
Slowly blow it up, make it pop

238
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,820
Pop pop pop, I'm ready to run, where my girls

239
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,620
So where my, where my girls?

240
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,620
Pure heart

241
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,220
I like Udon

242
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,600
But I'm so hungry right now

243
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,500
I want to recommend something that's good for all of us

244
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,520
That's my girl

245
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,920
Let's listen to a gentle piece

246
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,240
Rude song

247
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,920
She like it

248
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,620
Just out of my shoes

249
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,620
I'll show you how it's done

250
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,620
Why are you crying when you're at the academy?

251
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,620
Why are you crying when you're at the academy?

252
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,620
I'm sad because I'm happy

253
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,620
Sorry

254
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,620
The timing wasn't right

255
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,620
The timing wasn't right

256
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,620
In the bag? I don't have anything in my bag

257
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,620
I really don't have anything in my bag today

258
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,620
I really don't have anything in my bag today

259
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,620
I really don't have anything in my bag today

260
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,620
I really don't have anything in my bag today

261
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,620
Seoeon, please take a selfie today

262
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,620
Seoeon, please take a selfie today

263
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,620
Okay

264
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,620
Okay

265
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,620
The title of the song is

266
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,620
I left my heart

267
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,620
Show me your nails

268
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,620
I don't have any nails

269
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,620
I'm embarrassed

270
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,620
I can't see anything.

271
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,620
I don't like this place.

272
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,620
I think there's a lot of cute things here.

273
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,620
I'm watching that show.

274
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,620
What was it?

275
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,620
Not these days.

276
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,620
Not these days.

277
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,620
I started watching it today.

278
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,620
There's a song called...

279
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,920
I saw Lee Seyoung with her in the new film

280
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:42,460
I saw her 꽂아왔어요

281
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:52,160
I want to learn Japanese one day

282
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:58,220
I want to learn Japanese one day

283
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:12,620
I want to become good at Japanese and master it.

284
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,620
Let's watch LUNIVERSE together.

285
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:29,620
I want to watch it together, but I'm so hungry.

286
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,620
I'm so hungry.

287
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,620
I have to go eat.

288
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,620
I want to eat.

289
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,620
V is so nice.

290
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,620
There are still three minutes left.

291
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,620
There are only three minutes left?

292
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,620
No way.

293
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,620
Time flies so fast.

294
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,620
I'm pretty right now.

295
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,620
I'm pretty right now.

296
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,620
I want to do it for a long time.

297
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,620
Live.

298
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,620
Really.

299
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,620
The last song.

300
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,620
I think it's the last song.

301
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,620
I think it's the last song.

302
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,620
I found a really good song among Yena's songs.

303
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:41,620
There's a song in Yena's album called Love.

304
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,620
It was so good.

305
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,620
Oh, that was love.

306
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,620
Love.

307
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,620
When did this come out?

308
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,620
That was a nice challenge.

309
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,620
The last song.

310
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,620
Oh, this is the last song.

311
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,620
Oh, that was nice.

312
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,620
Love.

313
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,620
Love it!

314
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,620
This is the last song.

315
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,620
Iyan's the youngest.

316
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,620
It's just been holding me for a while.

317
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,620
I'll change that.

318
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,620
Is your heart berated?

319
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:24,620
So then...

320
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,620
I know.

321
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,620
I'm so emotional.

322
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,620
I think it'll come out.

323
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,620
It was fun.

324
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,620
Oh, I can't say it.

325
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,620
Kim Millie came out.

326
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,620
It was fun.

327
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,620
It was really hot then.

328
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,620
I went there when it was really hot.

329
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,620
It was really hot.

330
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,620
Hyeyeon, it's about time.

331
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,620
Let's watch the mini-verse now.

332
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,620
There's only one minute left.

333
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,620
Bye.

334
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,620
See you in the mini-verse.

335
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,620
What?

336
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,620
See you in the mini-verse.

337
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,620
You have to watch it.
