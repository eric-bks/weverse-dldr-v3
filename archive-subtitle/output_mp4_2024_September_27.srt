1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,976
Wow, this is the last one.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,976
It's the last one.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,976
I don't remember.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,976
What is it?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,976
Let's go.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,976
It's Kira.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,976
Kira! Kira!

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,976
Watashi Wa Star!

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,976
Hello.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,976
Today is a little...

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,976
It's a little...

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,976
It's a clear team.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,976
Unnie, what's this?

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,976
Did you drink?

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,976
It's that kind of time.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,976
What time is it?

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,976
It's...

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,976
45 minutes.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,976
Why is it 45 minutes?

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,976
It's 12 o'clock.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,976
It's late at night.

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,976
It's going to be the 28th.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,976
How has our day been?

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,976
Eunchae?

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm going to ask Eunchae this question.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So sad.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,976
Why, why?

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,676
Congratulations.

29
00:01:07,723 --> 00:01:09,975
Graduation congratulations.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,976
It was...

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,976
Because today.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,976
Because...

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,976
Graduation.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,976
I graduated.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,976
From Music Bank.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,976
Oh my god.

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,976
Everybody, applause.

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,976
Applause.

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,976
Thank you.

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,976
Well, today,

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,976
more people came in than usual.

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,976
It was the last time.

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,976
Really?

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,976
Really.

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,976
Why are you misunderstanding?

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,976
I'm still...

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,976
I don't want to be too sad.

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,976
I want to have a happy, happy day today.

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,976
I've been holding back my tears.

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,976
I've been having a lot of fun.

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,976
But Fearnot keeps crying.

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,976
But she was holding back her
tears at the end of the speech.

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,976
I know.

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,976
Really?

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,976
Because the signs in front of me

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,976
on the paper

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,976
They said they love you so much.

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,976
They said a lot of things.

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,976
I thought I was going to
cry, so I tried not to see it.

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,976
I didn't see it until the end.

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,976
So I didn't see what it said.

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,976
I love you so much.

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,976
Thank you.

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,976
Fearnot wrote something.

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,976
I posted it.

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,976
Don't forget.

67
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,976
Eunchae, I love you so much.

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,976
Of course I don't forget.

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,976
I can't forget these times.

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,976
I can't forget.

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,976
I'll cherish it in my heart.

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,976
When we make a comeback,

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,976
I think I'll be happy.

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,976
I'm going to make a comeback soon.

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,976
When I watched it,

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,976
Eunchae looked so happy.

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,976
I think I'm having a lot of fun.

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,976
I was so proud.

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,976
I was so sincere.

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,976
Eunchae's teenage years.

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,976
That's right.

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,976
It's really amazing.

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,976
It's really Eunchae's style.

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,976
She wrote me a letter.

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,976
I read one on my way here today.

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,976
Writer

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,976
Eunchae's precious teenage last

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,976
Thank you for being with
Music Bank for a long time.

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,976
There were these words.

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,976
Thank you so much.

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,976
They're really good people.

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,976
Really.

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,976
I love you.

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,976
Thank you so much.

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,976
Everyone was sincere.

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,976
Thank you so much.

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,976
Star Diary, too.

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,976
Star Diary is on my own.

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,976
I was a guest today.

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,976
I was alone.

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,976
It's so sad.

102
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,976
I thought I was going to cry.

103
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,976
Did you hold it in then?

104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,976
I held it in.

105
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,976
I cried after I finished.

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,976
Star Diary cried after the music video.

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,976
You cried after Star Diary.

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,976
I cried then, too.

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,976
We really didn't know they were coming.

110
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,976
We really didn't know at all.

111
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,976
We were really excited.

112
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,976
We always had expectations.

113
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,976
But we really didn't know.

114
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,976
So

115
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,976
We kept saying that we were sad

116
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,976
because there were no makeup artists.

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,976
But we knew they were coming.

118
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,976
So we were like,

119
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,976
it's going to be hard for Eunchae.

120
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,976
No, today

121
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,976
we told them to do well

122
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,976
at the end.

123
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,976
But they couldn't go

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,976
because they had to
prepare for the festival.

125
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,976
So the staff couldn't go with them.

126
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,976
The staff who were always with us

127
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,976
couldn't go with me.

128
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,976
So we were like,

129
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,976
it's really sad.

130
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,976
But we were really surprised.

131
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,976
Really.

132
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,976
It was fast, but we couldn't go.

133
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,976
It was a huge success.

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,976
Because we couldn't go

135
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,976
in the first class.

136
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,976
I forgot about it in the first class.

137
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,976
We had dinner.

138
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,976
Wow, seriously

139
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,976
your bangs...

140
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You're so short.

141
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's commanding one step forward.

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,976
That's recommended?

143
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That's cool.

144
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,976
I think we'll have to put that part

145
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,976
in our local...

146
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,976
I think what's coming up

147
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,976
will be...

148
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,976
It's the same.

149
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,976
It was really cute.

150
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,976
 It's been a year and seven
months, but it's so different.

151
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,976
I was surprised too.

152
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,976
The writers took my waiting room
like the X-Rom of Hwanseungnyeon.

153
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,976
Like X-Rom.

154
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,976
They took all my pictures
and put them on the wall.

155
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
In 2023 and 2024, they compared similar
pink clothes and put them on the wall.

156
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,976
It's really different.

157
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,976
It's really big.

158
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,976
You look like Eun Ji-won.

159
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,976
It's really big.

160
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,976
Is the speed too fast?

161
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,976
It's pretty big.

162
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,976
Time is fast.

163
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,976
Isn't the height still growing?

164
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,976
It's grown a lot since then.

165
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,976
And I prepared for the building today.

166
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,976
But the staff couldn't go with me.

167
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,976
So I ordered a cake while
I was in the bathroom.

168
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,976
Really?

169
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,976
They ordered a cake for me.

170
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,976
And I had a ribbon on my
head when I was in WORLD.

171
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,976
I had a cake with the ribbon on my head.

172
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,976
I was so surprised.

173
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,977
I was really surprised.

174
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,976
I got a cake to congratulate my graduation.

175
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,976
It was the best.

176
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,976
So on my way to work today,

177
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,976
I listened to WORLD's 7MEN's songs.

178
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,976
It's a song of memories.

179
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,976
Yes, it's a song of memories.

180
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,976
You did a great job.

181
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,976
Thank you so much.

182
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,976
You did a great job.

183
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,976
If you're watching this at home,

184
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,976
please give her a round of applause.

185
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,976
You did a great job.

186
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,976
After finishing the music video,

187
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,976
we went to the university festival.

188
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,976
That's right.

189
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,976
It was really fun.

190
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,976
How was it?

191
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,976
I think it's been a year and
a half since we went there.

192
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,976
I think it's been a year and a half.

193
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,976
There were much more songs than then.

194
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,976
I think there were much
more songs than then.

195
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,976
There were more famous songs.

196
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,976
That's right.

197
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,976
That was so cool.

198
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,976
All the students sang along.

199
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,976
The energy.

200
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,976
College festival is a college festival.

201
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,976
It was so fun.

202
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,976
The weather was perfect.

203
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,976
Oh, today's Gwagidae
festival was so much fun.

204
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,976
Really? Thank you.

205
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,976
Today's Gwagidae festival was the best.

206
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,976
It was fun today, too.

207
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,976
It's been a long time
since we've done Antifragile.

208
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,976
It's been a long time.

209
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,976
We did it during the tour, but we
didn't do it during the fan meeting.

210
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,976
It's definitely a representative song.

211
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,976
There was Gwagidae.

212
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,976
Thank you.

213
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,976
There were a lot of people.

214
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,976
Gwagidae has a lot of people.

215
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,976
There were a lot of people.

216
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,976
And overseas.

217
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,976
Are they foreign students?

218
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,976
There are a lot of foreign students.

219
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,976
I was surprised.

220
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,976
They sang all the songs.

221
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,976
That's right.

222
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,976
They sang it for us.

223
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,976
The first person to come from Seogangdae.

224
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,976
I heard that they waited from 6 a.m. today.

225
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,976
I was so surprised.

226
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,976
Thank you.

227
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,976
Let's go next week.

228
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,977
Right.

229
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:48,976
There are a lot of festivals planned.

230
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,976
There are a lot.

231
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,976
Seven.

232
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,977
Seven?

233
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:57,976
We'll go meet a lot of foreign students.

234
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,976
It's our first time to
visit a house in Korea.

235
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,976
It's our first time.

236
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,976
We're doing a fan signing event.

237
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,976
That's right.

238
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,977
I'm looking forward to it.

239
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:07,976
I've never been to a fan signing event.

240
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,976
It's finally fun.

241
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,976
I think it's going to be fun.

242
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,976
Everyone, don't get sick until that day.

243
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,976
Please wait for us.

244
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,977
I'll take care of my health.

245
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:19,976
I promise not to get hurt
while enjoying the festival.

246
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,976
That's right.

247
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,976
Keep it real.

248
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,976
Members, too.

249
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,976
That's right.

250
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,976
Stay healthy every day.

251
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,976
Let's have fun memories.

252
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,976
Yes.

253
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,976
Fun memories.

254
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,976
It was so much fun.

255
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,976
It's too late.

256
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,976
Good night.

257
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,976
I woke up.

258
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,976
It's 54.

259
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:44,976
It's too late.

260
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,976
It won't happen again, right?

261
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,976
Finally, Eunchae.

262
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,976
Well done.

263
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,976
You did a good job.

264
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,976
Thank you.

265
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,976
You worked so hard.

266
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,976
Wow.

267
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,976
Thank you.

268
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,976
Thank you so much.

269
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,976
What?

270
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,976
I'll give you a box of these.

271
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,976
How did you get so many colleagues?

272
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,976
You worked hard today.

273
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,976
Thank you.

274
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,976
Rain, too.

275
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,976
Thank you.

276
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Really.

277
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,976
Let's go.

278
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,976
The sleep was good.

279
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Good night.
