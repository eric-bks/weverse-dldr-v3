1
00:00:05,685 --> 00:00:07,729
I think we should wait a minute.

2
00:00:07,797 --> 00:00:09,664
Oh, it's up it's up.

3
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:21,112
♪ Korean HBD Song ♪

4
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,218
woo.

5
00:00:23,286 --> 00:00:25,671
Happy birthday.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

6
00:00:25,757 --> 00:00:27,929
It's our first time celebrating
a birthday together.

7
00:00:27,997 --> 00:00:28,934
That's right!

8
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:31,727
I didn't get sick.

9
00:00:31,794 --> 00:00:33,030
Finally.

10
00:00:33,098 --> 00:00:33,931
Seriously...

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,014
It's unbelievable that it's our first
time celebrating a birthday together.

12
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:39,343
It's so nice to have everyone here.

13
00:00:39,411 --> 00:00:40,932
It's the first time since debut.

14
00:00:41,552 --> 00:00:43,025
I feel so so good.

15
00:00:44,447 --> 00:00:46,076
The first time,
we were missing Eunchae.

16
00:00:46,165 --> 00:00:48,993
- That's right.
- But back then, Eunchae was busy.

17
00:00:49,061 --> 00:00:51,182
That's right.

18
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,663
Today was good timing.

19
00:00:53,736 --> 00:00:56,834
The timing wasn't good before, but today
we are healthy.

20
00:01:04,072 --> 00:01:05,933
Put it on your nose!

21
00:01:07,142 --> 00:01:08,342
I'm going crazy.

22
00:01:09,273 --> 00:01:10,510
How is this happening?

23
00:01:10,578 --> 00:01:12,740
Just throw that away.

24
00:01:12,808 --> 00:01:15,060
Wow, it's done!

25
00:01:15,128 --> 00:01:16,840
Queen of positivity.

26
00:01:17,474 --> 00:01:19,996
Why did you do that?

27
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:21,995
Is it good?

28
00:01:22,062 --> 00:01:23,994
Yeah, it's like whipped cream.

29
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:25,993
Yeah, I think it's whipped cream.

30
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,674
It tastes like my hands.

31
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:30,276
It's really pretty because
it's my handwriting.

32
00:01:30,344 --> 00:01:31,423
It's really pretty.

33
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,238
Yeah... Cute!

34
00:01:32,337 --> 00:01:33,989
I'm glad I took a picture earlier.

35
00:01:34,056 --> 00:01:37,678
Ah, I was going to show Fearnot.

36
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:40,145
Be careful.

37
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:42,879
This is...

38
00:01:43,816 --> 00:01:44,859
It's so pretty.

39
00:01:48,048 --> 00:01:49,732
I can't see it.

40
00:01:50,306 --> 00:01:53,114
I'll show you a picture later.

41
00:01:53,182 --> 00:01:56,203
- It's so pretty.
- Yunjin drew it.

42
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,117
That's right.

43
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:59,975
That's right. My hand painting is in it.

44
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:01,741
- It's so pretty.
- Thank you.

45
00:02:01,809 --> 00:02:03,116
- Shall we do it?
- Yes.

46
00:02:03,183 --> 00:02:05,003
- Firstly...
- What do you wanna do?

47
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:05,932
What should I do?

48
00:02:06,512 --> 00:02:07,970
Please choose.

49
00:02:08,388 --> 00:02:11,158
- It's really pretty.
- I think this is the color.

50
00:02:17,056 --> 00:02:19,965
"It's so pretty,
but the jellyfish light also looks good."

51
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,443
That's right.
There's a jellyfish light,

52
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,299
and its friends are here.

53
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:35,911
What...

54
00:02:36,952 --> 00:02:38,386
The sound...

55
00:02:38,454 --> 00:02:39,999
Oh it died out.

56
00:02:42,073 --> 00:02:43,140
It's lit.

57
00:02:43,855 --> 00:02:47,371
Happy birthday to you.

58
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,541
Happy birthday dear
Yunjin. Happy birthday to you.

59
00:02:52,637 --> 00:02:53,934
Make a wish!

60
00:02:54,002 --> 00:02:55,228
Retry!

61
00:02:55,295 --> 00:02:56,050
I don't know.

62
00:02:56,118 --> 00:02:57,944
Retry!

63
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,941
- It's the first try.
- Let's do it on purpose.

64
00:03:02,008 --> 00:03:03,940
Shall we do it now?

65
00:03:04,008 --> 00:03:06,125
Let's do it for real.
I'll erase this.

66
00:03:10,745 --> 00:03:13,082
It's my first time doing this,

67
00:03:15,315 --> 00:03:17,021
Thank you. Ok! Ready, set,

68
00:03:17,089 --> 00:03:18,933
Happy birthday to you.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,831
Happy birthday to you.

70
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:23,449
Happy birthday dear Yunjin.

71
00:03:23,516 --> 00:03:25,640
Happy birthday to you.

72
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:35,704
What happened?

73
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:43,766
Can you show us your outfit again?

74
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,662
Happy birthday.

75
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,170
It's today's outfit, Happy birthday.

76
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,914
"Happy Birthday."

77
00:03:51,263 --> 00:03:53,333
- It's my birthday.
- That's fitting!

78
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:54,249
It's my birthday.

79
00:03:54,323 --> 00:03:55,610
It's your birthday!

80
00:03:56,142 --> 00:03:57,454
It's just for today.

81
00:03:57,521 --> 00:03:59,723
Huh? Huh? Eh?

82
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,545
What happened?

83
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,907
It's like a magic trick.
(Her straw disappeared)

84
00:04:03,975 --> 00:04:05,039
It's fine.

85
00:04:05,106 --> 00:04:06,450
Don't you care?

86
00:04:07,326 --> 00:04:08,174
That's so funny.

87
00:04:08,242 --> 00:04:09,610
Black magic.

88
00:04:09,677 --> 00:04:11,191
Like magic.

89
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:12,842
Oh, thank you.

90
00:04:14,315 --> 00:04:15,593
It's a special day.

91
00:04:15,661 --> 00:04:16,846
- Yes, it's great.
- Yes.

92
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:20,202
Yes yes yes.

93
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,782
It's so nice.

94
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:23,565
What do we do now?

95
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:24,520
Oh, uh...

96
00:04:24,605 --> 00:04:26,811
How did you spend your day today?

97
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:28,802
Did you eat seaweed soup?

98
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,616
I didn't eat seaweed soup, no.

99
00:04:31,468 --> 00:04:33,014
Who will cook it for you?

100
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:34,774
Who will cook it?

101
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,671
I didn't eat seaweed soup,

102
00:04:36,738 --> 00:04:38,890
but I had a delicious Pad Thai.

103
00:04:38,957 --> 00:04:39,938
Pad Thai?

104
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:43,329
Yes, I had Pad Thai.
The managers got it for me.

105
00:04:43,397 --> 00:04:44,361
Saero?

106
00:04:44,429 --> 00:04:46,488
That's right.

107
00:04:47,084 --> 00:04:49,382
Delicious.

108
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:51,211
I drank coffee.

109
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:55,080
I had a good meal, and I feel great.

110
00:04:55,626 --> 00:04:59,120
You need to get a very fun photo.

111
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:02,908
The members sent some photos,
and they are so funny.

112
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:05,219
There's only funny pictures.

113
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:07,933
It's really pretty.

114
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,231
But they said it was okay.

115
00:05:09,299 --> 00:05:10,893
So, you can post it.

116
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,892
I don't have a choice.

117
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,553
Because it's so funny.

118
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:15,549
Kiss?

119
00:05:16,036 --> 00:05:18,369
Kiss?

120
00:05:18,549 --> 00:05:20,536
Mwah.

121
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:24,301
Yunjin-ah.

122
00:05:24,368 --> 00:05:25,623
Give us a ribbon heart.

123
00:05:25,802 --> 00:05:27,194
Was it like this?

124
00:05:28,752 --> 00:05:30,220
Oh, ribbon heart.

125
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,862
This is it.

126
00:05:32,788 --> 00:05:34,741
You didn't get presents yet, right?

127
00:05:35,014 --> 00:05:35,939
I gifted already.

128
00:05:36,006 --> 00:05:37,488
Oh, you did?

129
00:05:39,429 --> 00:05:40,654
Thank you.

130
00:05:41,024 --> 00:05:41,857
Thank you.

131
00:05:42,932 --> 00:05:45,876
And Yunjin gave us letters.

132
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:47,071
Ah, right.

133
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,159
She gave us letters one-by-one.

134
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:50,875
While we were by our self.

135
00:05:51,296 --> 00:05:53,522
I can't believe there's someone like this.

136
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:56,427
Oh, me? Yeah!

137
00:05:56,495 --> 00:05:57,388
Thank you.

138
00:05:57,455 --> 00:05:58,531
It's your birthday.

139
00:06:00,906 --> 00:06:02,144
Thank you.

140
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:04,293
She suddenly gave us letters.

141
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:06,930
Ah, but Chaewon was funny too.

142
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:09,276
"But wait, let me give this to you."

143
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:12,154
I liked it.

144
00:06:12,222 --> 00:06:15,311
When I went to London,

145
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:17,133
I went to an art exhibition

146
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:20,443
with my favorite works...

147
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:21,892
what was it?

148
00:06:22,434 --> 00:06:24,572
There were postcards or something

149
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,226
so, I bought it.

150
00:06:27,132 --> 00:06:28,174
It was a planned letter.

151
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:29,738
Yes, it was a planned letter.

152
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:31,827
I should have written a letter then

153
00:06:31,895 --> 00:06:33,166
[crosstalk]

154
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:34,615
We'd never do that.

155
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,609
Right.

156
00:06:36,677 --> 00:06:38,016
It's N, NF
(INFJ)

157
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,933
NF

158
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,447
And there's J.

159
00:06:42,515 --> 00:06:44,640
I'll give it to you.

160
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,371
Right and
the cover.

161
00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:48,869
Ah, right, right.

162
00:06:48,937 --> 00:06:50,490
It released today.

163
00:06:50,558 --> 00:06:51,816
Right, it did.

164
00:06:51,884 --> 00:06:53,816
[crosstalk]
(behind-the-scenes was old)

165
00:06:53,883 --> 00:06:56,323
You can tell by the different hair color.

166
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:58,383
I think it was in June.

167
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,944
Right, right.

168
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:00,853
Right, right.

169
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:05,272
Yes, yes.

170
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,937
Yes, yes, yes.

171
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:09,933
But.

172
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,933
When was it?

173
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:14,055
This year.

174
00:07:15,638 --> 00:07:20,587
Yes, yes, yes.

175
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:27,683
Oh, yes, yes.

176
00:07:29,656 --> 00:07:30,936
Chaewon knows.

177
00:07:31,004 --> 00:07:32,186
What is it?

178
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,054
Yes, yes, yes.

179
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:38,152
Yes, yes, yes.

180
00:07:39,503 --> 00:07:44,561
Finally, it's out.

181
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:46,173
It's really good.

182
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,788
Yes,
yes, yes.

183
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:51,337
This turtle is cute.

184
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:52,529
I'll take the turtle.

185
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:56,286
It's so cute.

186
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,602
What's that?

187
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,569
What is this?

188
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,646
- This?
- Isn't this a crocodile?

189
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,536
Isn't this a crocodile?
악어.

190
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:04,848
It's a crocodile
악어.

191
00:08:04,915 --> 00:08:06,447
It's so cute.

192
00:08:06,515 --> 00:08:07,978
No, they're so cute, too.

193
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:11,246
What do you call this?

194
00:08:11,313 --> 00:08:12,355
What do you call this?

195
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:14,789
Eunchae

196
00:08:14,857 --> 00:08:16,425
I don't know how
to say it in Korean.

197
00:08:16,493 --> 00:08:18,817
えい, えい, えい

198
00:08:18,885 --> 00:08:20,148
I was a kid at the aquarium.

199
00:08:20,216 --> 00:08:22,994
えい

200
00:08:23,062 --> 00:08:25,180
This is a "stingray".

201
00:08:26,377 --> 00:08:28,645
えい

202
00:08:28,712 --> 00:08:30,335
I don't know how
to say it in Korean.

203
00:08:30,424 --> 00:08:31,198
This is えい.

204
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,321
This is えい.

205
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:33,377
This is a whale. (고래)

206
00:08:34,332 --> 00:08:35,425
This is whale. (고래)

207
00:08:35,576 --> 00:08:37,638
This is a whale. (고래)

208
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,109
What's this one?

209
00:08:39,543 --> 00:08:40,488
Conch?

210
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,575
It's a conch.

211
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:47,622
Gaori (stingray)
Ah, 가오리.

212
00:08:47,689 --> 00:08:48,964
It's a stingray.

213
00:08:51,537 --> 00:08:52,886
This is a... hang on-

214
00:08:52,954 --> 00:08:53,910
It has a wide forehead.

215
00:08:53,977 --> 00:08:56,458
귀상어
Hammerhead.

216
00:08:56,538 --> 00:08:59,100
It's a shark. How does it see?

217
00:09:00,317 --> 00:09:02,050
There are jellyfish in the back.

218
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:03,745
Oh, yeah.

219
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,891
We haven't really talked
about your birthday.

220
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:13,982
There are so many things to explain.

221
00:09:15,837 --> 00:09:16,670
Oh, right.

222
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:22,630
- We have to make a wish.
- Then
- We will pick one.

223
00:09:24,893 --> 00:09:25,749
Nice

224
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:26,649
I like that.

225
00:09:27,611 --> 00:09:28,595
The ring too.

226
00:09:29,998 --> 00:09:30,831
It's cute.

227
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,933
Then...

228
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:35,244
I'll pick one.

229
00:09:35,704 --> 00:09:37,237
Please pick.

230
00:09:37,955 --> 00:09:38,948
Please pick one.

231
00:09:41,601 --> 00:09:42,434
No,

232
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,726
- What?
- Start.

233
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:46,371
I got a flower hat.

234
00:09:48,697 --> 00:09:49,789
I'm looking forward to it.

235
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:51,616
Party...

236
00:09:51,684 --> 00:09:53,034
Is it okay?

237
00:09:53,102 --> 00:09:54,659
Totally.

238
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:57,376
Stickers?

239
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,340
Here's a sticker.

240
00:10:00,454 --> 00:10:02,114
I got a party whistler.

241
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:03,315
Party whistler.

242
00:10:05,653 --> 00:10:07,142
I'm sunglasses

243
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:10,476
[crosstalk]

244
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,754
Pppppppp.

245
00:10:12,282 --> 00:10:13,566
Oh, that surprised me.

246
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:18,998
Eunchae, don't you think it's
a little disappointing?

247
00:10:19,066 --> 00:10:19,447
Me?

248
00:10:19,515 --> 00:10:20,061
Yeah,

249
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:22,177
ppppppppppppp.

250
00:10:20,815 --> 00:10:21,984
Oh, it matches your outfit.

251
00:10:22,058 --> 00:10:23,134
Is that so?

252
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:26,814
Pppppppppppppppppp.

253
00:10:23,391 --> 00:10:24,474
It's a perfect fit.

254
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:26,312
But this... this...

255
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,294
Eunchae,
I think this would be nice too.

256
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:30,699
It's up to you.

257
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,282
Pp pp pppppppp.

258
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,921
Happy birthday.

259
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:42,488
Thank you, everyone.

260
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:43,556
Perfect.

261
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:46,223
Eunchae, that looks like it's your hair.

262
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:48,896
It's really looks like hair.

263
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:52,035
- I should do that hair.
- You have to do that hair smiling.

264
00:10:52,103 --> 00:10:53,686
Cute! Pretty!

265
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,100
She's Rudolph.

266
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:57,090
Oh, it's so cute.

267
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,122
Why is it so huge on you?

268
00:10:59,189 --> 00:11:01,187
It's so cute. I like it.

269
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:03,493
It's really cute.

270
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:06,074
Okay, let's capture time naturally.

271
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,340
Oh, it's working.

272
00:11:09,162 --> 00:11:10,085
The cake

273
00:11:17,613 --> 00:11:18,446
pp

274
00:11:18,787 --> 00:11:19,874
pppppp.

275
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,739
Why won't it work?

276
00:11:26,242 --> 00:11:28,326
Good. Nice. Good.

277
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:30,556
Let's taste the cake.

278
00:11:30,677 --> 00:11:32,730
- Why don't we try the cake?
- I want to try it.

279
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:33,800
I want to taste.

280
00:11:35,132 --> 00:11:36,817
I think you have to cover your eyes.

281
00:11:36,884 --> 00:11:38,194
Wanna wear a blindfold?

282
00:11:38,501 --> 00:11:39,802
Oh, should I?

283
00:11:39,869 --> 00:11:40,702
Okay.

284
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,158
Could you give me a bite?

285
00:11:43,225 --> 00:11:45,321
Please give me a good bite.

286
00:11:45,388 --> 00:11:46,327
Right.

287
00:11:47,985 --> 00:11:50,055
Culinary Class Wars, the crazy chef.

288
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:52,183
It was so nice until the end.

289
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:52,841
Really?

290
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:54,466
I was watching with Zuha earlier.

291
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:56,315
There was a new dish.

292
00:11:56,409 --> 00:11:58,065
Oh, it came out already.

293
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:59,434
Did it come out today?

294
00:11:59,502 --> 00:12:01,635
I only saw it yesterday.

295
00:12:02,702 --> 00:12:03,934
So the winner is...

296
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:05,385
Hurry up, before it's spoiled.

297
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:11,022
Sniff it.

298
00:12:11,116 --> 00:12:12,394
What is this?

299
00:12:12,462 --> 00:12:13,434
Smell it?

300
00:12:18,674 --> 00:12:20,433
But I didn't look up to here.

301
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:22,797
I didn't look too long

302
00:12:23,048 --> 00:12:24,114
I don't know.

303
00:12:24,182 --> 00:12:25,668
Ahh.

304
00:12:25,735 --> 00:12:26,433
Oh.

305
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,433
Oh.

306
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,433
Oh.

307
00:12:29,871 --> 00:12:30,472
Hmm?

308
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,265
- Mmm.
- Is this how you do it?

309
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,000
I haven't seen that yet.

310
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,216
But it's really good.

311
00:12:36,383 --> 00:12:37,812
What does it taste like?

312
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:39,930
First of all, the whipped cream.

313
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,492
How so?

314
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,928
- It's very light
- Light?

315
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,676
It's light.

316
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:46,127
- Yes yes
- Wow, that's awesome.

317
00:12:46,206 --> 00:12:50,169
It's very light, the bread is moist,

318
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,242
the whipped cream is delicious.

319
00:12:54,237 --> 00:12:56,225
- This is chocolate chip.
- It's chocolate chip.

320
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:57,405
Chocolate chip?

321
00:12:57,472 --> 00:12:58,610
It's a chocolate chip.

322
00:13:02,063 --> 00:13:02,931
Wow.

323
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:04,005
I really like chocolate.

324
00:13:04,072 --> 00:13:06,505
There's a lot of chocolate chips.

325
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:09,356
I like the texture.

326
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,540
Yes, it's kind of...

327
00:13:13,258 --> 00:13:17,420
I think it's like in a frappe, delicious,
The cake is delicious, yes,

328
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,033
Oh, the jellyfish cake,
when I thought of it, this.

329
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:23,736
About the the cake,

330
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:28,303
The fresh cream is important.

331
00:13:29,337 --> 00:13:31,323
The fresh cream is very tight.

332
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:33,791
No, no, I can't say right now.

333
00:13:34,085 --> 00:13:34,799
Jellyfish cake.

334
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:37,379
She said it very clearly and tightly.

335
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,581
Oh, that? What is it?

336
00:13:42,117 --> 00:13:43,097
Jellyfish cake.

337
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:46,175
Top cake!

338
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:51,989
Thank you. I'm really enjoying this.

339
00:13:52,217 --> 00:13:52,939
Seriously.

340
00:13:53,097 --> 00:13:55,433
Isn't that show so fun?

341
00:13:56,727 --> 00:13:59,375
Chef Jung Ji-Sun,
I'm a huge fan.

342
00:13:59,443 --> 00:14:02,212
Chef Jung Ji-Sun nim.

343
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:03,758
Ah, don't spoil anything!

344
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,768
Thank you Park...

345
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:08,893
I want to eat that dim sum.

346
00:14:09,591 --> 00:14:13,610
Dim Sum, Tiramisu, Mala Jjampong.

347
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:15,189
Macreme.

348
00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:17,519
Don't spoil it.

349
00:14:17,865 --> 00:14:21,909
- It's just a dish.
- It's fun. Right.

350
00:14:22,705 --> 00:14:23,836
Please watch it.

351
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,019
I want to eat it.

352
00:14:26,892 --> 00:14:28,996
It's based on when Yunjin watches.

353
00:14:29,128 --> 00:14:31,447
I can't watch till the end.

354
00:14:31,515 --> 00:14:33,480
I think we can watch it until the end.

355
00:14:34,496 --> 00:14:39,387
Originally, I couldn't watch
shows till the end but when Yunjin,

356
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,638
is watching, it's
more interesting.

357
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:47,060
It's my first time
finishing a series.

358
00:14:47,837 --> 00:14:49,768
Tiramisu is coming out.
I'll want it. Where?

359
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,874
We will do a Weverse live eating it.

360
00:14:53,942 --> 00:14:54,620
Where?

361
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:57,979
I think it's sold by
the convenience store.

362
00:14:58,046 --> 00:14:59,140
The convenience store.

363
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,933
You can buy it at the
convenience store.

364
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:07,034
I want to eat jjamppong today.

365
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:08,518
Napoli Mafia

366
00:15:08,586 --> 00:15:09,827
I want jjampong now.

367
00:15:10,712 --> 00:15:15,329
- The Nappoli Mafia.
- Who is the most famous chef.

368
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:18,233
Who was the most impressive chef?

369
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:19,859
The goddess of China.

370
00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:23,775
She was the mentor of the two.

371
00:15:23,843 --> 00:15:25,253
The teacher.

372
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:35,595
Yes, I thought their relationship
was so heartwarming.

373
00:15:35,662 --> 00:15:37,421
I agree.

374
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:40,744
I have no idea what's going on.

375
00:15:40,892 --> 00:15:41,791
Let's move on.

376
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,223
So, there's something
we have to do today.

377
00:15:46,811 --> 00:15:47,657
Of course.

378
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:48,441
This one?

379
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:50,579
TMI Quiz?

380
00:15:50,968 --> 00:15:54,710
How many questions do we have?

381
00:15:56,351 --> 00:15:57,168
I'm out of my mind!

382
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:58,756
You have to raise your hand quickly.

383
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,886
With your name.

384
00:16:04,815 --> 00:16:05,648
Today...

385
00:16:05,954 --> 00:16:07,572
What time did I wake up today?

386
00:16:10,465 --> 00:16:12,908
It was a little late today.

387
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,240
Right? It was late. But-

388
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,140
Chaewon.

389
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,333
9:00 am?

390
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:18,307
The closest person gets it.

391
00:16:18,515 --> 00:16:19,144
Okay, okay.

392
00:16:19,297 --> 00:16:21,036
I'll give no reactions.

393
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,163
Eunchae!

394
00:16:23,735 --> 00:16:24,687
3:00 pm.

395
00:16:24,816 --> 00:16:25,763
That's way too late.

396
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:26,664
Kkura!

397
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,385
No, no, you already said it.

398
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,540
It's so funny.

399
00:16:30,694 --> 00:16:31,527
12:00 pm.

400
00:16:32,554 --> 00:16:33,387
Zuha!

401
00:16:35,346 --> 00:16:36,373
7:00 am.

402
00:16:36,493 --> 00:16:37,365
What?

403
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:38,558
6:00 am.

404
00:16:38,626 --> 00:16:39,459
What?

405
00:16:39,553 --> 00:16:41,000
Eunchae, Eunchae, Eunchae

406
00:16:41,094 --> 00:16:44,189
[crosstalk]

407
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:45,846
The closest person is...

408
00:16:45,914 --> 00:16:47,692
It's me, it's me!

409
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,310
Please, be me.

410
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,109
You must have slept for quite a long time.

411
00:16:53,177 --> 00:16:55,612
I slept for a seriously long time today.

412
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,433
Good job.

413
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,433
I usually go to bed late

414
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,268
I always sleep really late these days.

415
00:17:01,613 --> 00:17:02,511
Well done.

416
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:03,432
Good job.

417
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,814
Today...

418
00:17:05,018 --> 00:17:08,645
I was going to wake up early and have a...

419
00:17:08,718 --> 00:17:10,518
miracle morning.

420
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:11,380
Miracle morning?

421
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,949
Yes,
I was going to have a very busy morning

422
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:14,793
I knew it.

423
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,659
I was going to go to a cafe,
take a walk, and see an exhibition,

424
00:17:18,726 --> 00:17:22,657
but then I just wanted to sleep.
I slept late.

425
00:17:22,724 --> 00:17:24,023
- I should sleep.
- That's right.

426
00:17:27,105 --> 00:17:29,201
Eunchae, 1 point.

427
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:31,388
You almost spent your birthday asleep.

428
00:17:31,455 --> 00:17:33,155
I know, half of it

429
00:17:33,222 --> 00:17:35,097
yea, yea.

430
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,540
Yeah, I like it a lot.

431
00:17:37,421 --> 00:17:39,476
Next TMI.

432
00:17:50,921 --> 00:17:52,941
What do I want to do right now?

433
00:17:53,382 --> 00:17:54,399
Now?

434
00:17:54,472 --> 00:17:55,978
Ah, today. Today?

435
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,833
Just recently?

436
00:17:58,938 --> 00:17:59,915
Eunchae.

437
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,021
Go to a hot pot restaurant.

438
00:18:02,695 --> 00:18:03,528
Okay, next.

439
00:18:04,404 --> 00:18:05,739
I'm not sure what to say.

440
00:18:05,873 --> 00:18:07,396
This is the last one?

441
00:18:07,464 --> 00:18:10,750
The last one.

442
00:18:10,818 --> 00:18:11,907
Zuha.

443
00:18:12,274 --> 00:18:13,686
Go to eat with the members.

444
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,505
Isn't it too similar?

445
00:18:15,573 --> 00:18:16,490
No, no, no, no,

446
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:18,486
but where are you going?

447
00:18:21,252 --> 00:18:24,766
- Going together.
- But it's similar
- Even if it's not.

448
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:28,152
- Let's go eat with the members.
- Okay, okay, okay.

449
00:18:28,219 --> 00:18:28,878
Wait a minute.

450
00:18:28,945 --> 00:18:30,265
Go to eat meat

451
00:18:30,338 --> 00:18:31,543
eating...?

452
00:18:33,802 --> 00:18:34,909
Drawing.

453
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:38,870
You don't have it.

454
00:18:38,937 --> 00:18:40,691
Why, why, why, why?

455
00:18:40,758 --> 00:18:43,168
I think it's going to be real?

456
00:18:43,353 --> 00:18:44,353
Drawing.

457
00:18:48,825 --> 00:18:50,413
If you don't have it,
you don't have it.

458
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,466
No, no, no.

459
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,605
Zuha got it. That's right.

460
00:18:56,673 --> 00:18:59,366
It's not hot pot. It's not meat.

461
00:18:59,434 --> 00:19:00,272
Tell me.

462
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:06,130
Okay, okay, okay, whatever.

463
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:10,798
- I'm hungry
- One point
- What was it?

464
00:19:12,474 --> 00:19:14,494
Fearnot is chewing?

465
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:18,808
Chewing?

466
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,702
All of a sudden?

467
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:23,590
That's right too.

468
00:19:23,657 --> 00:19:24,510
What was it?

469
00:19:32,366 --> 00:19:34,075
Can Fearnot ask a question?

470
00:19:34,143 --> 00:19:36,075
Is there anything Fearnot is curious of?

471
00:19:43,534 --> 00:19:44,539
What is there?

472
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:46,519
TMI is really hard
Um Let's try one more.

473
00:19:50,032 --> 00:19:52,355
Let's try one more
One more.

474
00:20:00,462 --> 00:20:01,328
Ah,

475
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:10,632
The birthday present I wanted?

476
00:20:10,746 --> 00:20:11,579
Eunchae.

477
00:20:13,305 --> 00:20:14,277
Not that one.

478
00:20:14,344 --> 00:20:15,595
Not that one.

479
00:20:15,662 --> 00:20:16,432
Kkura.

480
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,483
Just a letter.

481
00:20:17,604 --> 00:20:19,540
Ah, okay.

482
00:20:20,671 --> 00:20:22,439
Ah, Eunchae, that...

483
00:20:25,188 --> 00:20:27,095
Even-if-it's-wrong, hand wash.

484
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,738
Oh, okay.

485
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:31,339
Ah, the one we talked about earlier?

486
00:20:31,407 --> 00:20:32,302
- Ah,
- I don't know.

487
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:35,112
I've won.

488
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:40,095
- I think I can do it
- What else is there?

489
00:20:42,424 --> 00:20:43,257
Meat.

490
00:20:43,464 --> 00:20:46,029
You can only say meat.

491
00:20:46,096 --> 00:20:49,257
Chaewon mentioned she
was hungry at the start.

492
00:20:49,324 --> 00:20:51,495
Please understand.

493
00:20:51,562 --> 00:20:53,507
What's so funny?

494
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:55,473
So funny.

495
00:20:57,555 --> 00:20:59,691
Drawing.

496
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,426
I draw.

497
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,433
Me?

498
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,433
I drew it.

499
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,433
As a real sister.

500
00:21:06,501 --> 00:21:08,107
I draw.

501
00:21:08,175 --> 00:21:10,375
What?
Do you really want me to do it?

502
00:21:10,955 --> 00:21:16,329
Good good.
What are you talking about?

503
00:21:16,396 --> 00:21:17,676
It's so funny I like everything.

504
00:21:18,321 --> 00:21:22,521
I like everything,
but I always get a letter. 저는 다 너무 좋지만.

505
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,673
Isn't that right?

506
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:28,842
One point.

507
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,892
Then, what should I do?

508
00:21:30,982 --> 00:21:32,743
Then what should I do?

509
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,303
The last one.

510
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,953
The last one will Fearnot's.

511
00:21:40,256 --> 00:21:41,870
No, do you really want that?

512
00:21:43,905 --> 00:21:45,686
Body wash?

513
00:21:47,023 --> 00:21:49,442
Hand cream? Hand wash?

514
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,817
- Body lotion.
- I love it body lotion.

515
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:53,269
I love it.

516
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:03,146
- Why?
- My body lotion.

517
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,514
Mm, what is that?

518
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:10,502
Oh, that? That... What is it?

519
00:22:11,437 --> 00:22:12,935
What color hair do you want to try?

520
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:18,060
Eunchae.

521
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:19,104
Green.

522
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,394
Zuha! Pink.

523
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:27,246
Silver.

524
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:29,319
Chaewon
Brown.

525
00:22:35,343 --> 00:22:36,381
For me... Wait!

526
00:22:36,449 --> 00:22:38,266
- Hang on.
- No, no, no.

527
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,719
But green is...

528
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:43,351
It was the green that came
out when you lost your blue.

529
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
Yes, yes, yes

530
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:46,543
Eunchae!

531
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:47,688
Huh? Really?

532
00:22:47,755 --> 00:22:50,538
I spoke to the hairdresser
a few days ago.

533
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:54,753
Right, right, right.

534
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:57,025
- So I was convinced.
- EUNCHAE was confident.

535
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,773
That's right
It's really unique.

536
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:04,773
When I fell in love
with the color white.

537
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:10,672
I fell in love with the
color green.

538
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Oh, that.

539
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:17,172
Thank you.

540
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:18,931
Good good

541
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:22,199
Eunchae: No.1.

542
00:23:22,743 --> 00:23:24,798
Do you know what it is?

543
00:23:24,992 --> 00:23:28,019
Dibidibi-dip.

544
00:23:28,235 --> 00:23:29,454
Then, this is just.

545
00:23:29,522 --> 00:23:35,974
- You can choose randomly.
- Okay
- Great.

546
00:23:38,755 --> 00:23:40,433
Okay, good.

547
00:23:41,617 --> 00:23:42,655
Why?

548
00:23:43,095 --> 00:23:46,750
- So cute
- Why?

549
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:50,748
- My favorite.
- Mine's the cutest.

550
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,116
Isn't it a dress?

551
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:58,914
- I like Jennifer
- This is my favorite.

552
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:01,002
Homemade.

553
00:24:01,069 --> 00:24:02,812
This is pretty.

554
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:04,740
It's pretty when you laugh.

555
00:24:04,807 --> 00:24:06,966
- It's really pretty.
- You are really pretty here.

556
00:24:07,033 --> 00:24:08,193
It's the bangs.

557
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,433
It's bangs.

558
00:24:13,629 --> 00:24:15,311
What's the name?

559
00:24:15,378 --> 00:24:17,828
It's pretty.

560
00:24:17,895 --> 00:24:19,572
- It's so cute.
- What do you have?

561
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,001
I like it now.

562
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:24,184
It's so pretty.

563
00:24:24,252 --> 00:24:25,305
It's so cute.

564
00:24:25,373 --> 00:24:27,209
It's like a Pokemon.

565
00:24:27,276 --> 00:24:28,431
It's so cute.

566
00:24:28,498 --> 00:24:30,726
It's pretty.

567
00:24:31,294 --> 00:24:33,438
Fearnot must be jealous.

568
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:35,983
I'm jealous of you.

569
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,613
- I envy Fearnot
- I envy you.

570
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:43,056
Can you show it closer?
This is really cute.

571
00:24:44,778 --> 00:24:46,500
It's little.

572
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,717
It's so funny.

573
00:24:51,221 --> 00:24:53,220
It's so funny.

574
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:58,799
It's cute.

575
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:00,582
It was cute.

576
00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:01,761
Thank you.

577
00:25:01,828 --> 00:25:03,637
It's already been a year.

578
00:25:04,443 --> 00:25:06,427
That's right.

579
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:08,705
That's right.

580
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,123
It was so sad.

581
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,210
But with Fearnot.

582
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:14,692
It's so nice to be
able to do it live.

583
00:25:19,183 --> 00:25:20,524
It's pretty.

584
00:25:20,592 --> 00:25:21,964
It's so nice to be
able to do it together.

585
00:25:22,031 --> 00:25:24,275
It's so nice.

586
00:25:24,342 --> 00:25:26,696
I'll choose one,

587
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:28,701
and give a really
good message to you.

588
00:25:29,512 --> 00:25:31,126
I'll give it to you as a gift.

589
00:25:31,325 --> 00:25:34,071
- It's random, right?
- Do I have to do it too?

590
00:25:34,146 --> 00:25:37,844
We'll give it to you.

591
00:25:44,025 --> 00:25:45,120
It's not easy.

592
00:25:45,187 --> 00:25:46,319
It's not easy?

593
00:25:46,386 --> 00:25:47,290
You have to go first.

594
00:25:47,358 --> 00:25:48,258
It's me.

595
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,683
I'll do it first.

596
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,682
Let me be the first.

597
00:25:52,749 --> 00:25:53,920
I don't think I can do it.

598
00:25:55,837 --> 00:25:56,903
Is it just one sentence?

599
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,420
Yes, in one sentence.

600
00:25:58,487 --> 00:25:59,992
You're playing for the first time?

601
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,844
Do you say it with the words?

602
00:26:01,911 --> 00:26:03,883
- Including our words
- Can I do it?

603
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:05,200
Can I do it?

604
00:26:05,911 --> 00:26:09,199
"From the moment I <i>first</i> saw you."

605
00:26:11,045 --> 00:26:13,002
I think I should've gone first.

606
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,678
Please enjoy this.

607
00:26:14,752 --> 00:26:17,512
Next! Next! It's your turn.

608
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:20,323
"From the moment I first saw you."

609
00:26:21,452 --> 00:26:22,740
"She was a <i>princess</i>."

610
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,951
Ah, it's over...

611
00:26:26,387 --> 00:26:29,432
Prin...

612
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:32,772
"You were like a <i>princess</i>."

613
00:26:32,952 --> 00:26:34,254
- Okay
- I can't go either.

614
00:26:34,574 --> 00:26:36,900
No, you can do it like
this and then at the end.

615
00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:39,642
That's right,
the word should be somewhere.

616
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:41,415
- You were a princess
- Like a princess.

617
00:26:41,483 --> 00:26:43,032
You were a princess.

618
00:26:45,556 --> 00:26:49,378
Like a princess...

619
00:26:49,605 --> 00:26:51,032
I'll do it then.

620
00:26:51,272 --> 00:26:52,649
- You're done
- What is it?

621
00:26:52,717 --> 00:26:56,646
- Show us Zuha.
- Tell us.

622
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:03,230
"As if she were a princess, I will
love Yunjin for <i>the rest of my life</i>."

623
00:27:03,878 --> 00:27:07,480
[Sakura giving suggestions]

624
00:27:07,548 --> 00:27:08,807
Zuha, Zuha, let her go.

625
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:14,570
"From the moment I first saw her, I told
her that I would love her like a princess."

626
00:27:14,638 --> 00:27:16,495
"You said you would love me
forever like a princess,

627
00:27:16,562 --> 00:27:18,754
so today I made you <i>Kimchi Jjigae</i>." (?)

628
00:27:19,482 --> 00:27:20,634
Please eat.

629
00:27:20,702 --> 00:27:24,064
It's Kimchi Jjigae.

630
00:27:24,131 --> 00:27:25,632
How do you use this?

631
00:27:25,699 --> 00:27:27,875
But... This is my style.

632
00:27:29,076 --> 00:27:30,733
You have to put it like this.

633
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,086
Is it supposed to be like this?

634
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,729
- It's hard.
- I think it's too much
- I want to talk about it.

635
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,173
It's so colorful.

636
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,623
I want to talk about it.

637
00:27:41,955 --> 00:27:45,633
Last time it was really...
It was perfect.

638
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,620
It's been a long time
since I've seen you.

639
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:51,405
It was fun. It was good.
Thank you so much.

640
00:27:51,473 --> 00:27:52,602
It was good.

641
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,708
Thank you so much

642
00:27:54,782 --> 00:27:58,783
I decided to love you forever.

643
00:27:58,851 --> 00:28:00,388
Tofu Kimchi Jjigae.

644
00:28:01,496 --> 00:28:05,703
It's TMI It's PS PS.

645
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:06,698
It was good.

646
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,073
It was so good.

647
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,600
I can't even imagine.

648
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,130
Let's check the comments.

649
00:28:18,151 --> 00:28:19,183
"This is live, right?"

650
00:28:19,257 --> 00:28:23,074
Yes, It's live,
It's not prerecorded.

651
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:25,495
This is Weverse Live.

652
00:28:26,097 --> 00:28:27,473
Is this right live?

653
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,174
Yes.

654
00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:29,966
It's not Sanhok.

655
00:28:30,632 --> 00:28:33,400
Let's give a round of applause
Why?

656
00:28:33,468 --> 00:28:34,546
It's a good day.

657
00:28:35,032 --> 00:28:37,143
Thank you.

658
00:28:39,981 --> 00:28:40,867
Okay.

659
00:28:40,935 --> 00:28:44,601
Let's do these.

660
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,795
It must be really good. Oh.

661
00:29:18,808 --> 00:29:20,705
From today...

662
00:29:21,945 --> 00:29:23,533
with the love I received...

663
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,784
"I will try to become a member

664
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:29,047
who is proud to grow every day."

665
00:29:29,115 --> 00:29:30,303
Oh, it's so perfect.

666
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,776
It's not from today,
but it's already like that.

667
00:29:31,843 --> 00:29:33,718
Already perfect.

668
00:29:33,785 --> 00:29:35,562
Thank you.

669
00:29:35,629 --> 00:29:37,201
From birth!

670
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:38,473
From the time I was born.

671
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:39,560
How old are you?

672
00:29:39,627 --> 00:29:41,472
I'm 23 years old now.

673
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:43,127
Then from 23 years ago.

674
00:29:43,194 --> 00:29:45,556
That's right.

675
00:29:46,345 --> 00:29:48,618
When were you born?

676
00:29:49,284 --> 00:29:49,984
Me?

677
00:29:50,051 --> 00:29:53,831
- If I reveal it, it's a little...
- Oh, really?

678
00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:55,891
Send me a message via Kakao Talk.

679
00:29:55,958 --> 00:29:57,659
I'll send you a
message via Kakao Talk.

680
00:29:57,726 --> 00:29:58,674
Do you know what it is?

681
00:29:58,742 --> 00:29:59,656
Dangerous period.

682
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,546
Oh, Busan-like.

683
00:30:05,901 --> 00:30:07,545
I'm sorry.

684
00:30:07,612 --> 00:30:09,240
I've been to Busan.

685
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,889
Busan-like?

686
00:30:10,956 --> 00:30:13,345
It's hectic!

687
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:14,356
It's like this.

688
00:30:14,727 --> 00:30:16,640
Ppppppppp.

689
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,680
"Yunjin is so cute."

690
00:30:20,747 --> 00:30:21,987
"Hug all together."

691
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:24,534
Hug me.

692
00:30:24,873 --> 00:30:25,842
Let's hug.

693
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:30,340
It's quiet.

694
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,640
It's so funny.

695
00:30:34,034 --> 00:30:36,124
"Did you make the
jellyfish light yourself?"

696
00:30:36,192 --> 00:30:37,038
Yes.

697
00:30:37,105 --> 00:30:39,818
Yes, I made it myself.

698
00:30:39,885 --> 00:30:41,764
Wow, you did a great job.

699
00:30:41,831 --> 00:30:43,372
This balloon never fell.

700
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:45,524
Isn't that great?

701
00:30:45,591 --> 00:30:47,593
The world is helping.

702
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,734
I think it's going to fall.

703
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:52,492
I worked really hard.

704
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:54,885
I worked really hard.

705
00:30:54,952 --> 00:30:57,518
Actually, I made up a lie.

706
00:30:57,979 --> 00:31:01,259
But,
there are so much jellyfish in the world.

707
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:03,514
Yeah, but there are a lot.

708
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:05,089
They're all cute.

709
00:31:05,439 --> 00:31:07,319
Should I like it too?

710
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:08,872
Yeah, I like it a lot.

711
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,557
I like it too. Shouldn't I like it?

712
00:31:12,155 --> 00:31:13,509
Should we like it together?

713
00:31:14,243 --> 00:31:15,508
"Let's love together."

714
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:20,206
I love you.

715
00:31:22,196 --> 00:31:24,415
Is there Fearnot whose birthday is today?

716
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:28,370
Happy birthday!

717
00:31:28,437 --> 00:31:31,154
There are a lot of
birthdays in October.

718
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:36,276
Congratulations!

719
00:31:38,503 --> 00:31:40,348
Rachel's birthday
is also in October.

720
00:31:40,416 --> 00:31:42,511
Really?

721
00:31:42,932 --> 00:31:45,452
Now?

722
00:31:46,985 --> 00:31:48,589
"The cover was so good."

723
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,457
Thank you.

724
00:31:50,524 --> 00:31:52,530
Is there a reason why
you chose that song?

725
00:31:52,597 --> 00:31:54,666
I...

726
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:58,640
wanted to try a genre
called Bossa Nova.

727
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,409
The lyrics are so good
and the song is so good.

728
00:32:02,477 --> 00:32:04,780
I got to be close with Laufey.

729
00:32:05,034 --> 00:32:11,920
I thought it would be nice to
cover the song of that friend's sister.

730
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:17,625
- I'll look at the lyrics.
- It's so pretty.

731
00:32:17,692 --> 00:32:20,128
The mood itself is so pretty.

732
00:32:21,015 --> 00:32:24,372
And she also majored
in classical music.

733
00:32:24,439 --> 00:32:25,815
Really?

734
00:32:25,882 --> 00:32:27,195
Yes, classical.

735
00:32:27,915 --> 00:32:29,950
She's a classical
vocalist and a cello player.

736
00:32:32,865 --> 00:32:33,698
She's so talented.

737
00:32:33,925 --> 00:32:35,873
She's very talented.

738
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:41,338
I love it.

739
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,898
"Who was first to
celebrate your birthday?"

740
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:46,289
Zuha!

741
00:32:46,356 --> 00:32:47,458
That's right.

742
00:32:47,525 --> 00:32:50,955
At first, Zuha sent it to me
first and at the same time,
everything went in a flurry.

743
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:55,072
As soon as I saw 12 o'clock,
it was a flurry.

744
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,762
What time did you wake up?

745
00:32:56,829 --> 00:32:57,662
Yesterday?

746
00:32:57,832 --> 00:33:00,227
At about 5 o'clock?

747
00:33:00,294 --> 00:33:01,451
4 o'clock

748
00:33:01,518 --> 00:33:03,768
I didn't sleep much, did I?

749
00:33:03,836 --> 00:33:04,985
I just slept well

750
00:33:05,053 --> 00:33:08,721
I slept very well.

751
00:33:10,633 --> 00:33:11,846
"Do you like bossam?"

752
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:15,006
Does Bossa mean bossam?

753
00:33:15,074 --> 00:33:17,050
Yes, Bossa means bossam.

754
00:33:17,117 --> 00:33:18,677
Bossam Nova, yes, yes.

755
00:33:18,744 --> 00:33:20,339
You like Bossa, right?

756
00:33:20,406 --> 00:33:22,165
Bossam, Bossam Nova.

757
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,675
"Crazier is a really good song."

758
00:33:26,742 --> 00:33:29,795
Thank you.

759
00:33:29,863 --> 00:33:32,866
No, that was on our
recording behind-the-scenes.

760
00:33:32,935 --> 00:33:34,808
That was so funny.

761
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:36,639
The forehead.

762
00:33:36,706 --> 00:33:38,074
It was definitely the forehead.

763
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,430
I gave up on that.

764
00:33:39,497 --> 00:33:41,779
I really gave up on that.

765
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:43,428
I gave up as I directed.

766
00:33:43,495 --> 00:33:45,133
It was so funny.

767
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,444
It was really fun.

768
00:33:46,511 --> 00:33:48,183
It was so funny.

769
00:33:50,478 --> 00:33:51,424
It was cute.

770
00:33:52,503 --> 00:33:54,511
Was that summer?

771
00:33:54,675 --> 00:33:55,547
It was summer.

772
00:33:55,614 --> 00:33:57,421
When was it?

773
00:33:57,488 --> 00:33:59,419
It was summer.

774
00:33:59,486 --> 00:34:01,418
It wasn't summer.

775
00:34:01,485 --> 00:34:03,417
It wasn't summer.

776
00:34:03,484 --> 00:34:05,433
Because we were practicing.

777
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,415
Because we were practicing.

778
00:34:07,482 --> 00:34:09,414
The hair.

779
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:11,413
Did you grow it?

780
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,412
Yes.

781
00:34:13,479 --> 00:34:15,411
Cute.

782
00:34:15,478 --> 00:34:17,410
She kept saying.

783
00:34:17,965 --> 00:34:19,219
It was cute.

784
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:22,712
I think this is really cute.

785
00:34:24,412 --> 00:34:25,404
It's so neat.

786
00:34:25,472 --> 00:34:28,020
I think we can capture it.

787
00:34:28,198 --> 00:34:29,031
It's so cute.

788
00:34:30,661 --> 00:34:31,639
What is this?

789
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:32,907
It's here.

790
00:34:34,346 --> 00:34:35,400
That's right.

791
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:36,630
It's the mouth.

792
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:38,869
It's cute.

793
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:43,396
"Eunchae marry me."

794
00:34:45,674 --> 00:34:47,394
Sorry.

795
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,474
Not yet.

796
00:34:53,148 --> 00:34:54,053
It's cute.

797
00:34:55,625 --> 00:34:57,388
"What is your favorite
word in English?"

798
00:34:58,726 --> 00:34:59,880
Happy birthday.

799
00:35:07,768 --> 00:35:10,102
In short, it's HBD.

800
00:35:10,288 --> 00:35:12,393
HBD.

801
00:35:12,467 --> 00:35:13,380
It's text.

802
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:16,828
Happy birthday.

803
00:35:16,896 --> 00:35:19,601
생.축.
Saeng Chuk.

804
00:35:19,996 --> 00:35:21,058
Thank you.

805
00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:23,374
Many people want
to congratulate you.

806
00:35:24,439 --> 00:35:25,373
That's right.

807
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,753
Thank you.

808
00:35:27,912 --> 00:35:29,371
But your birthday isn't over yet.

809
00:35:29,439 --> 00:35:30,390
It's not over.

810
00:35:31,853 --> 00:35:32,814
You can press it.

811
00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:33,626
Okay.

812
00:35:33,702 --> 00:35:37,195
Right, I thought it was a month.

813
00:35:38,758 --> 00:35:41,470
I will start from the 10th.

814
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:46,726
I'm a month.

815
00:35:46,794 --> 00:35:48,880
Okay.

816
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:50,977
We can do it.

817
00:35:51,044 --> 00:35:52,878
Oh, I know.

818
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:56,876
I'll leave it.

819
00:35:56,943 --> 00:35:58,875
Okay.

820
00:35:58,942 --> 00:36:00,874
Congratulations.

821
00:36:01,082 --> 00:36:02,850
The last word.

822
00:36:02,917 --> 00:36:04,020
I love you.

823
00:36:06,905 --> 00:36:07,944
Thank you.

824
00:36:08,027 --> 00:36:12,617
Congratulations.

825
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:14,031
Bye-bye.

826
00:36:14,152 --> 00:36:15,763
