1
00:00:12,233 --> 00:00:13,533
Mm-Hmm...

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,933
Hello?

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,333
Are you there?

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,933
Hi. Hello hello.

5
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:24,933
Hello

6
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,000
Good evening

7
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:32,167
Hi

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,700
No...

9
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:39,767
Aigo! Aigo!

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,100
I dropped my phone

11
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:44,233
On my face!

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,200
It's night, so I should be quiet

13
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:54,233
I dropped my phone on my face

14
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,033
This big Galaxy

15
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,667
I finished my schedule

16
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,833
I washed up and laid down

17
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,433
I was so seriously bored

18
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:16,767
So I turned Live on

19
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,567
Samuachi

20
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:29,500
In Japanese, Samuachi

21
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:30,567
Please send it

22
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,300
Good night

23
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:35,767
"What did you do today?"

24
00:01:35,833 --> 00:01:37,333
Today?

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,167
I filmed all day

26
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,033
There was a filming

27
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,167
"A story about vacation?"

28
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:48,933
I went on vacation

29
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,967
I went to Nha Trang with my family

30
00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:54,100
But Fearnot recognized me

31
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:55,600
Because it's a resort

32
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:57,567
And it was a holiday

33
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:00,800
So most of the Koreans

34
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:05,000
There were a lot of people,
mostly Koreans.

35
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:06,633
Those who also came on vacation

36
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:10,600
So, many people knew about me

37
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:13,300
They call me a fan

38
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,800
I was worried that I'd be uncomfortable

39
00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:19,967
When was it? While I was eating?

40
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:21,967
They pretended not to recognize me,

41
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:24,700
but when we were leaving at the end,

42
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:25,967
They said, "I'm your fan!"

43
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:27,800
And simply left.

44
00:02:27,867 --> 00:02:28,800
So

45
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,600
I was so thankful

46
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:34,033
That little consideration

47
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,900
I was thankful

48
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:41,733
I felt so happy

49
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,733
You said you're a fan.

50
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:54,933
And what was it?

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Scubadiving and

52
00:02:57,967 --> 00:02:59,600
Snorkeling and a lot of

53
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:01,000
Other water packages.

54
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:03,267
But I can't bear it

55
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:06,300
But up until then,

56
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:12,900
I figured no one would
recognize me since I'm overseas.

57
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:18,733
I didn't care about anything with her

58
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,067
You know that it's really the
worst if your hair is all wet, right?

59
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,200
I just walked around like that,

60
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,833
But there were a lot of
tourists in front of me,

61
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,467
and they were calling me.

62
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,200
I must have been so flustered.

63
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,133
Oh, so, "Wow. Oh, please!
This is, oh, this is."

64
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:52,467
"Thank you so much for recognizing me,"

65
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:56,467
"but if you took a photo,
I really hope you don't post this."

66
00:03:57,967 --> 00:03:59,233
That's what I thought,

67
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:01,167
but they didn't post it.

68
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:02,433
Thank you.

69
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:06,433
I think when they saw it too,

70
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,333
"Oh, this is Chaewon."

71
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,200
"I don't think I should post
this for Chaewon's sake."

72
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,933
Really...

73
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,467
Please just keep it.

74
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,567
"I'm drunk after drinking Jim Beam."

75
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:37,833
Huh? "I'm drunk after drinking Jim Beam?"

76
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
How much did you drink?

77
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,967
You can't drink well.

78
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,533
"Chaewon, what did you eat for dinner?"

79
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,167
I really think I'm going
to be scolded by Fearnot,

80
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,767
but I didn't have dinner.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,133
"What's with the sound of the motorcycle?"

82
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,500
I just opened the window in my room.

83
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:07,000
Can you hear the sound of a motorcycle?

84
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:08,700
That's amazing.

85
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:13,267
Jim Beam, it's whiskey.

86
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, there's whiskey and highball.

87
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:18,200
I thought you were talking about highball.

88
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:20,167
It's good to drink whiskey.

89
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:27,033
"How many cans of Jim Beam can you drink?"

90
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,800
I haven't counted it,

91
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:34,100
but it's so delicious

92
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,333
that it's easy to drink.

93
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,300
It's delicious.

94
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:42,500
Isn't it really delicious?

95
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:48,067
I'm really satisfied with my job.
The best.

96
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:04,433
"What did you learn in Japanese?"

97
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,133
Oh yeah... Japanese?

98
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,000
Japanese?

99
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,167
There's something I learned today

100
00:06:21,267 --> 00:06:25,467
[JP] I don't know which
side of my hair is better

101
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:27,067
Ah, no

102
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:34,167
[JP] I don't know which
side of my hair is better

103
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:42,367
I learned that.

104
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,267
[JP] This side or this side?

105
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,467
[JP] Yes

106
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:01,467
[JP] So cute

107
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:09,267
[JP] Japanese people always call me cute

108
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,367
[JP] Even when I'm shooting

109
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:17,700
[JP] Cute

110
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:19,500
[JP] Fearnot is also cute

111
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:24,000
[JP] Thank you

112
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:40,633
[JP] Is the weather
hot in Japan right now?

113
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,767
[JP] Is it cold?

114
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,467
[JP] I'm...

115
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:47,800
[JP] I'm going to Japan soon

116
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:48,600
What's it?

117
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:51,100
What should I do?
I forgot a lot of Japanese

118
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:58,967
[JP] I'm going to Japan soon

119
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,933
[JP] Is it cold?

120
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:07,933
[JP] It's cold in Korea too

121
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,700
[JP] Soon, soon

122
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:09,967
Ah, right, right

123
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:13,367
[JP] I'm going to Japan soon

124
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:16,600
[JP] What's the weather like in Japan?

125
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:19,400
[JP] Ah, it's cold, right?

126
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:20,867
[JP] I understand.

127
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,700
But isn't the weather so nice right now?

128
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,833
I really like this weather

129
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,533
It's a cool weather

130
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Well

131
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:36,633
In a way, it's cold

132
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,133
In a way, it's hot

133
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,433
Hot weather

134
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:43,500
"Is it too cold?"

135
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:45,000
But for me

136
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:46,733
Winter is colder

137
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,500
I think it's perfect now

138
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,000
Sorry, I can't read Chinese characters

139
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:06,000
[JP] "It's warmer than in Korea"

140
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:09,200
Is it warm?

141
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:13,067
Oh, it's warmer than Korea.

142
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
It doesn't make a sound.

143
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,233
[KR] "What did you just say?"

144
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:22,700
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:28,500
I'm speaking Japanese
because I have Japanese Fearnot.

146
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,033
Wat?

147
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:36,533
"Do you recommend me a late night snack?"

148
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:40,267
What would be good?

149
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,167
I really like ssambap these days.

150
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,400
Is it lunch or breakfast?

151
00:09:48,267 --> 00:09:51,133
But ssambap is so good these days.

152
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,100
Delivery.

153
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:55,933
You can eat it in one bite.

154
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,167
It's a wrap.

155
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,900
So it was so delicious.

156
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:06,500
I hope they sell a lot of ssambap.

157
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,833
Ssambap.

158
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:13,367
There aren't that many
places that deliver it.

159
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,833
I'm hungry.

160
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm not hungry all the time.

161
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,400
Before I go to bed,

162
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:39,933
I'm hungry.

163
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:42,900
What's wrong with you?

164
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,800
"Recommend me a good song
to listen to when you study."

165
00:10:49,867 --> 00:10:52,967
When you study, just study.

166
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:54,533
Don't listen to music.

167
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,167
Or listen to something that focuses well.

168
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
What do you think?

169
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:11,167
ASMR

170
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:38,933
"Chaewon, what hair color
do you want to do next time?"

171
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,367
I want to do something calm next time.

172
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:45,300
I don't want to bleach my hair.

173
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,233
I want to dye my hair black or brown.

174
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:56,167
I just happened to see a
picture of me with long hair.

175
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,600
So I want to grow my hair.

176
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,267
No, but how can I grow my hair?

177
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:08,367
I can't grow my hair just
by wanting to grow hair.

178
00:12:10,433 --> 00:12:13,867
That's why I have hair extensions.

179
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:18,633
But it hurts when I have hair extensions.

180
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,900
It's uncomfortable.

181
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:23,567
Then, Fearnot.

182
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:25,200
Can you really wait for me

183
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:27,233
while I grow my hair out?

184
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,900
Can you wait for me for a while?

185
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,100
Can you wait for me?

186
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,333
"Chaewon, you've never
done an album with long hair."

187
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,000
omg.

188
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:50,133
Actually true.

189
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:54,167
What to do? I suddenly want long hair.

190
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,533
I want to grow my hair long.

191
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:03,067
"I'll wait for you."
Really?

192
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,600
But I really want to grow my hair,
Fearnot.

193
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:13,133
But it will take a few years.

194
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,167
"You look good with short hair.
Do you have short hair, too?"

195
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:21,333
Wait a minute, Fearnot.

196
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,067
Let's unify.

197
00:13:24,867 --> 00:13:27,933
Let's unify. Fearnot, let's unify.

198
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:35,433
Can you wait?

199
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,933
"Grow it first."

200
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,267
Okay.

201
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:46,333
I want to grow it, too.

202
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,367
Did you fall in love with short hair?

203
00:13:58,433 --> 00:13:59,333
Oh, my.

204
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:02,867
I do have short hair, though...

205
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,167
"I'll do anything."

206
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
You like everything, Fearnot.

207
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:19,067
Huh?

208
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:21,133
Tell me you like everything.

209
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:25,467
Okay.

210
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:27,733
I'll decide now.

211
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,300
Fearnot,
I've heard a lot of people's opinions.

212
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:32,700
I'm going to think about it a lot.

213
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:37,233
I'll think of a way to satisfy

214
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,567
both long-haired and short-haired people.

215
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:43,900
"What about the other members?"

216
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:49,367
Wouldn't they be resting
or sleeping in their rooms?

217
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:56,767
"You caught a cold.
I think your voice is sick."

218
00:14:57,267 --> 00:14:59,367
I didn't catch a cold.

219
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,767
It's my voice.

220
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,667
"Chaewon, you scored a goal in Korean!"

221
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:16,367
Wow.

222
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:17,933
Congratulations.

223
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:21,467
What about soccer?

224
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,800
Can you speak English for me?

225
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
Yes!

226
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,533
Of course!

227
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:54,100
ASMR?

228
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,067
How is it?

229
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,067
This sound?

230
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:20,400
My evil sorry

231
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:23,400
Man

232
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,833
Evil

233
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,333
Yes it's good

234
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:59,267
- "Chaewon, did you see
Culinary Class Wars?"
- I watched all of it.

235
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,400
All of it.

236
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:22,800
However, I think their
cooking skill is extraordinary.

237
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,667
How made they cook like that?

238
00:17:26,267 --> 00:17:27,233
I mean,

239
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,100
Their cooking skill is
really extraordinary.

240
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:33,067
When I saw it, I thought,

241
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:34,933
I have to do this dish,

242
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,867
I have to do this new dish.

243
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,833
I think they're really, really amazing.

244
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:53,167
"What's your favorite
Sabrina Carpenter song?"

245
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:55,433
Me? There are so many.

246
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,367
But there are so many. What should I do?

247
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,000
Among them...

248
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:14,533
I can't choose.

249
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,300
I'm hungry.

250
00:18:31,267 --> 00:18:33,100
Let's give a big spoiler

251
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:34,767
One.

252
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,733
I'm really sorry,
but there's nothing to spoil

253
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,300
"Wait, should I put some ramen?
How about ramen cooking?"

254
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:49,233
No, don't.

255
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,867
Don't eat it.

256
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:54,767
If you don't do it, I won't do it.

257
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:57,500
No, I won't.
It's too late now.

258
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:03,267
But it's too late.
Because tomorrow will be early.

259
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,933
"Did you catch a cold?"

260
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,767
"Chaewon said, did I catch a cold?"

261
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,000
Did I catch a cold?

262
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,567
Why?

263
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:13,700
I didn't catch a cold.

264
00:19:15,433 --> 00:19:16,867
Did I catch a cold?

265
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:19,600
What's wrong with me?

266
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:21,967
Is my voice weird?

267
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:27,033
"Will the views go up if you cook ramen?"

268
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,167
Don't say things like that.

269
00:19:30,233 --> 00:19:31,933
I really won't eat ramen.

270
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:34,600
"My voice is weird?"

271
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:35,833
Oh my god.

272
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,967
No, because I'm...

273
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:42,867
Because it's just before bed.

274
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:50,367
"No, it's because I don't
know your calm voice."

275
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:51,833
Right?

276
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,467
It's my voice.

277
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,433
I always...

278
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,200
Something...

279
00:19:57,267 --> 00:20:01,667
Is it because I'm talking in a high tone?

280
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:05,567
"Can you turn on the camera?"

281
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:07,967
I'm sorry.

282
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:12,167
I'm not ready to show my face right now.

283
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,867
"Chaewon, can I say hello
if I run into you by chance?"

284
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:21,833
Please do it.

285
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:26,267
Then I think it will be
a really good memory.

286
00:20:30,633 --> 00:20:35,300
Ah, right now, there's
something that's really on my mind.

287
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:40,467
When I was on that family trip,

288
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:44,333
someone recognized me at the airport

289
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:48,633
I was walking with my sister.

290
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,433
I was walking with my sister.

291
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,633
He tapped me and said, "Kim Chaewon".

292
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,533
I...

293
00:20:57,067 --> 00:21:00,733
He was the first person

294
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,133
who recognized me when I arrived.

295
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,000
I was so flustered that I said,

296
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:09,267
"No! I'm sorry!"

297
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,100
I went there, and it was definitely me.

298
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:17,333
So I want to tell him

299
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,233
Actually, I was Kim Chaewon

300
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,767
I'm sorry.

301
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:25,400
I was so surprised that I lied.

302
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:28,633
I was so surprised that I lied.

303
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:31,267
That's what I thought.

304
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,800
I'm sure he came with courage.

305
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,600
When I said no, he just left.

306
00:21:44,667 --> 00:21:46,900
That hurt me even more.

307
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:48,267
So...

308
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,700
I was hit. I'm sorry.

309
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,233
"Chaewon recommend a drama to watch."

310
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:12,933
I like "Lover of the Moon" these days.

311
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:15,833
I'm watching it again.

312
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:19,433
I used to watch it a lot.

313
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,033
So I will.

314
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,367
But the vibe that I saw then,

315
00:22:26,233 --> 00:22:29,167
The feeling and the atmosphere,

316
00:22:29,233 --> 00:22:31,533
And the content is really fun.

317
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,667
That's right.

318
00:22:34,933 --> 00:22:36,067
It's really fun.

319
00:22:36,133 --> 00:22:39,100
The story is crazy.

320
00:22:41,513 --> 00:22:45,299
- "It's really sad, isn't it?"
- That's right. It's
hard because it's sad.

321
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:46,333
The last one.

322
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,233
It's so much fun that I'm rewatching it.

323
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,433
"I fall asleep when I hear your voice."

324
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:04,567
Is it a good thing?

325
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,100
That's a good thing, right?

326
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:08,867
Do I have to do something like this?

327
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,233
Radio, content like this?

328
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:18,600
No, there's a voice live.

329
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,133
I'll turn on the voice live often.

330
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,633
"Chaewon, let's count the sheep."

331
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,433
I don't count sheep.

332
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,700
When I can't sleep.

333
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:37,233
When I can't sleep,

334
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:40,767
I don't think I have a lot
of times when I can't sleep.

335
00:23:42,133 --> 00:23:43,800
What do I do when I can't sleep?

336
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,167
"I read a book."

337
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,300
If I read a book, I can't sleep.

338
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:57,533
Is it because I keep
using my eyes like this?

339
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,267
Or when I use my cell phone,
I can't sleep.

340
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:03,367
Is it because my eyes are tired?

341
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,600
"Do you sleep well even after coffee?"

342
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,467
I think I sleep well
even if I drink coffee.

343
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:43,600
I don't drink that much coffee.

344
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:51,133
I'm lying down.

345
00:24:57,533 --> 00:25:00,800
Are you sleepy now everyone?

346
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:02,633
If you're sleepy, go to bed Fearnot.

347
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,667
If you're sleepy, go to bed.

348
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:10,433
To have a good night's sleep,

349
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,200
You know you can sleep
well when you're sleepy, right?

350
00:25:21,933 --> 00:25:24,000
Chaewon, how is Siro these days?

351
00:25:24,067 --> 00:25:25,333
Siro?

352
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,967
He doesn't listen to me.

353
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:34,067
He's a troublemaker.

354
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,333
"Have you ever been bitten by Siro?"

355
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,567
I've never been bitten by Siro.

356
00:26:02,267 --> 00:26:04,900
"Chaewon, please tell me the
combination of Yoa and Jung."

357
00:26:04,967 --> 00:26:06,767
I don't know the
combination of Yoa and Jung.

358
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,367
I don't know that combination well,
actually.

359
00:26:14,433 --> 00:26:16,000
But I like fruit rings.

360
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:21,733
Choco shell, choco pop, and fruit ring.

361
00:26:22,533 --> 00:26:24,533
It's delicious if you eat it.

362
00:26:32,533 --> 00:26:34,367
- "What's going on?"
- Eh?

363
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,433
Oh my god.

364
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,333
There's someone who's older than me.

365
00:26:46,733 --> 00:26:48,200
Chaewon, marry me.

366
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,433
Marry me~

367
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:03,967
Marry me.

368
00:27:04,033 --> 00:27:08,300
I'm singing this song all of a sudden.

369
00:27:28,267 --> 00:27:30,267
Ah, that's right.

370
00:27:56,433 --> 00:27:58,667
"Chaewon,
I want to see a dance challenge."

371
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:02,233
Dance challenge?

372
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,367
Ok.

373
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:12,067
"Chaewon, did you know that there
are less than 90 days left this year?"

374
00:28:12,133 --> 00:28:14,933
No way.
Isn't time too fast?

375
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,067
Isn't time too fast?

376
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:24,033
When did the year go by so fast?

377
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:03,067
Isn't time too fast?
Time flies so fast, doesn't it?

378
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,067
Then is Eunchae an adult, too?

379
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,567
OMG. I suppose so.

380
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,100
Oh time is super fast.

381
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,500
But what I felt was that

382
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,000
Really, really really,

383
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Among the Fearnots,

384
00:30:30,067 --> 00:30:36,900
There's Fearnot that
I've known for a long time,

385
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,133
There's Fearnot who are new,

386
00:30:41,933 --> 00:30:45,133
I'm so thankful and
precious to all of you.

387
00:30:46,867 --> 00:30:52,933
It's been about six years since I debuted

388
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,800
in the entertainment industry, right?

389
00:30:59,533 --> 00:31:06,567
I saw it from the beginning

390
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,933
And I'll keep on going.

391
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,467
And it's amazing that Fearnots

392
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,033
have been supporting me all this time.

393
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:43,067
I'm so grateful.

394
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:27,700
If I stay with all the
Fearnots for a long time,

395
00:32:27,767 --> 00:32:32,333
we'll be amazing.

396
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,400
I think we're going to fall in love.

397
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:38,567
We're in trouble if we don't
have each other anymore.

398
00:32:40,033 --> 00:32:41,033
That's right.

399
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,700
"Chaewon,
you have to do it until your 50s."

400
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:16,633
Oh, yes.

401
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,767
50s...

402
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,733
I'll try my best so that I'm strong.

403
00:33:24,533 --> 00:33:25,533
50 years old.

404
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:28,967
I exercise a lot.

405
00:33:29,033 --> 00:33:31,367
I eat a lot of nutrients.

406
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:34,867
I'll do it until I'm in my 50s.

407
00:33:36,067 --> 00:33:38,100
Le Sserafim, I'll try my best.

408
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,767
I'm in my 50s...

409
00:33:43,733 --> 00:33:45,733
Can I do fearless?

410
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:18,800
Oh, that was interesting,
too. Those who liked me for a
long time was also a Fearnot,

411
00:34:18,867 --> 00:34:44,600
but what kind of job I got, listening
to the stories of each Fearnot.

412
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,900
- "Can I look forward to Golden Wave?"
- Please look forward to it.

413
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:24,033
Should I go to bed now?

414
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:42,367
I'll go to bed now.

415
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:44,867
"No."

416
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,000
Why? No, it's late Fearnot

417
00:35:57,167 --> 00:35:59,333
Someone planned it.
Right?

418
00:36:02,133 --> 00:36:03,733
Is 12 o'clock late?

419
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,667
It's late.

420
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:07,233
Why?

421
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,833
Let's go to bed.

422
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:18,367
I'm sorry, but it's time to go to bed.

423
00:36:39,267 --> 00:36:41,767
"Isn't it early for the market now?"

424
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:45,200
Right.

425
00:36:45,267 --> 00:36:47,767
It's the earliest time.

426
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,900
"Chaewon, hurry up."

427
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:03,500
It's not dinner right now.
What do you mean, fortune teller?

428
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,233
It's a fortune teller. (?)

429
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:08,867
I'm going to eat after I wake up.

430
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,300
This is the beginning.

431
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:19,167
Oh my gosh, that word is the scariest. (?)

432
00:37:25,733 --> 00:37:26,967
Amechu?

433
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,733
Amechu?
In the morning...

434
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,333
I can't think of anything right now.

435
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,367
Bagel?

436
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,867
Bagel.

437
00:38:16,467 --> 00:38:19,600
Ssambap.

438
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:23,400
There's only ssambap
in my stomach right now.

439
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,467
London bagel looks delicious.

440
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,700
Nemo Nemo Nemo Nemo

441
00:38:34,433 --> 00:38:35,900
"I hate bagels."

442
00:38:36,967 --> 00:38:39,567
Don't eat bagels then. Eat rice.

443
00:38:40,233 --> 00:38:42,933
Is there something wrong with bread?

444
00:38:47,067 --> 00:38:48,733
"Recommend the best Jimbeam then?"

445
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,633
The ginger that comes out this time.

446
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,867
Wow, but the comments are getting faster.

447
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,200
"I like you more than bagels."

448
00:39:26,633 --> 00:39:29,767
What was that? It's so cheesy.

449
00:39:30,933 --> 00:39:31,933
????????

450
00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:36,400
Thank you, Fearnot.

451
00:39:40,033 --> 00:39:43,867
Thank you, thank you. Don't get hurt.

452
00:39:45,933 --> 00:39:47,367
I'm just kidding.

453
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:14,567
Then I'm going to go to bed now.

454
00:40:14,633 --> 00:40:18,400
Why? Because I have an early day tomorrow.

455
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:30,600
"From now on,
the person who sleeps is a fool."

456
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:33,000
Then I will be a fool.

457
00:40:36,733 --> 00:40:38,500
Fearnot...

458
00:40:38,567 --> 00:40:41,867
You've done a good job today.

459
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:49,833
Let's all be fools.

460
00:40:52,267 --> 00:40:55,467
Fearnot, you know what?

461
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:59,033
If you sleep now,
you'll be happy tomorrow.

462
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:06,867
You have to sleep now to sleep well
and have a good condition, so you
won't have any regrets tomorrow.

463
00:41:12,733 --> 00:41:14,700
Anyeong. Bye bye.

464
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,767
See you next time.

465
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:20,067
Bye.

466
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,733
Bye bye.

467
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,800
Good night.

468
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,000
I'm really going.

470
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,933
Bye bye.
