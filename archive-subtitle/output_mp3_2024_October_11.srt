1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello? Are you there?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hi.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hello, hello.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Don't be angry.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Thank you.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hello.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hello.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hello.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hello.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hello.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hello.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hello.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
No.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I dropped my phone.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
On my face.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's night, so I'll be quiet.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I dropped my phone on my face.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This big galaxy.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm so bored.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I took a shower and lied down.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I was so bored.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I was so bored.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So I turned on the V LIVE.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Samuachi.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
In Japanese, samuachi.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Samuachi.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
In Japanese, samuachi.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
They sent it to me.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Good night.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What did you do today?

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Today?

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I filmed all day.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
There was a shoot.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
A story about vacation?

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I went on vacation.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I went to Naturang with my family.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But they recognized me a lot.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I went on vacation.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I went on vacation.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Most of the Koreans

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
were Korean.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They came to travel.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So many people recognized me.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
They called me a fan.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I was afraid I'd feel uncomfortable.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
When I eat?

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
When I eat?

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
They don't pretend to know.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,500
When I was about to leave, she said she was a fan.

50
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,700
So, I was so thankful.

51
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,200
That little consideration.

52
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,800
I was thankful.

53
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,800
I was so happy.

54
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Because she said she was a fan.

55
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
And what was it?

56
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:53,800
I played with the scuba diving and snorkeling like a package.

57
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,800
But until then, I said,

58
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
This is overseas.

59
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Because it's overseas, no one will recognize it.

60
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
I was so thankful.

61
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
I was so thankful.

62
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
I was so thankful.

63
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,800
Because it's overseas, no one will recognize it.

64
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,800
I didn't care about anything with her.

65
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,800
If she cut my hair, it would be the worst.

66
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,800
That's what I did.

67
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:33,800
But there were so many tourists in the boat.

68
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,800
They were calling me.

69
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,800
So I was so flustered.

70
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
So I was like,

71
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Please, this is...

72
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,800
This is...

73
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,800
I was so thankful that they recognized it.

74
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,800
But if they took a picture, I wish they didn't upload it.

75
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,800
That's what I thought.

76
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,800
But thankfully, they didn't upload it.

77
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,800
I think when they saw it,

78
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Chaewon said,

79
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,800
I shouldn't upload it for that.

80
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Really...

81
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Please keep it for yourself.

82
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,800
I'm drunk.

83
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
I'm drunk because of JinBin.

84
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
I'm drunk because of JinBin?

85
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
How much did you drink?

86
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,800
You can't drink.

87
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
What did you have for dinner?

88
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,800
I think I'm going to get in trouble.

89
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,800
I didn't have dinner.

90
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
What's with the sound of the motorcycle?

91
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
I left the window open.

92
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Can you hear the motorcycle?

93
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,800
That's amazing.

94
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
JinBin, it's whiskey.

95
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
There's whiskey and highball.

96
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
I thought you were talking about highball.

97
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
I thought you were talking about highball.

98
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Whiskey makes you drunk.

99
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
How many cans of JinBin can you drink?

100
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
I haven't counted it.

101
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
But it's so good.

102
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
It went in.

103
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,800
It's good. Isn't it really good?

104
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Job satisfaction is the best.

105
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,800
What did you learn in Japanese?

106
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
In Japanese...

107
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Japanese...

108
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,800
Japanese...

109
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
I learned something today.

110
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
I don't know which one is better.

111
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
I don't know which one is better.

112
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,800
No.

113
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,800
I don't know which one is better.

114
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
I don't know which one is better.

115
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,800
I don't know which one is better.

116
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,800
I learned this.

117
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Cute.

118
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Everyone in Japan...

119
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Always...

120
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
To me...

121
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
It's cute.

122
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,800
Even when we're shooting,

123
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Cute.

124
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
The piano is cute.

125
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Thank you.

126
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
In Japan...

127
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
In Japan...

128
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Is the weather hot right now?

129
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Is the weather hot right now?

130
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Is it cold?

131
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
I...

132
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Soon?

133
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
What's soon?

134
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
What was it?

135
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
I forgot a lot of Japanese.

136
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
I...

137
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
I'm going to Japan.

138
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
I'm going to Japan.

139
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Is it cold?

140
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,800
It's cold in Korea too.

141
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,800
Soon.

142
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,800
I'm going to Japan soon.

143
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
How is the weather in Japan?

144
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,800
It's cold, right?

145
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
I understand.

146
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
Isn't the weather so nice right now?

147
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
I really like this weather.

148
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
It's a cool weather.

149
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,800
It's cold in some ways.

150
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,800
It's hot in some ways.

151
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
Is it too cold?

152
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
But I...

153
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,800
It's colder in winter.

154
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
I think it's perfect right now.

155
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,800
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
I can't read Chinese characters.

157
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Is it warmer than Korea?

158
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
It's warmer than Korea.

159
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,800
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
I'm sorry.

166
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
It's warm.

167
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
I can't hear you.

168
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
What did you say?

169
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
I can't read Japanese.

171
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
I can't read Japanese.

172
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
I can't read Japanese.

173
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
What?

174
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
Recommend me a late night snack.

175
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,800
What should I recommend?

176
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
I love ssambap these days.

177
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
Today, at lunch...

178
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
Is it lunch or breakfast?

179
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
I had ssambap.

180
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
But these days,

181
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
Ssambap is so good.

182
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
You can eat it in one bite.

183
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
You can eat it in one bite.

184
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,800
It's wrapped in ssam.

185
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,800
It's wrapped in ssam.

186
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
So it was so delicious.

187
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
I want you to sell a lot of ssambap.

188
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
I want you to sell a lot of ssambap.

189
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
I want you to sell a lot of ssambap.

190
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
There aren't many places to deliver ssambap.

191
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
There aren't many places to deliver ssambap.

192
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
There aren't many places to deliver ssambap.

193
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
I'm hungry.

194
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
I'm not always hungry.

195
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
I'm hungry before I go to sleep.

196
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,800
I'm hungry before I go to sleep.

197
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
What's wrong with you?

198
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
Recommend me a good song to listen to when you study.

199
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,800
When you study, just study.

200
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
When you study, just study.

201
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
Don't listen to the song.

202
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
Or

203
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
Listen to the sound of concentration.

204
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,800
Listen to the sound of concentration.

205
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
Listen to the sound of concentration.

206
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
ASMR

207
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Is there a hair color you want to try on?

208
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
Is there a hair color you want to try on?

209
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
I want dig placing next time.

210
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
I want to try this kind of電그레이.

211
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
I want to try this kind of Monthly 24 chest.

212
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,800
I want to try this kind of Monthly 24 chest.

213
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
I want to try this kind of Monthly 24 chest.

214
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,800
I want to try this kind of Monthly 24 chest.

215
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
I want to try this kind of Monthly 24 chest.

216
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
I want to try this kind of Monthly 24 chest.

217
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Now, maybe I was a little j uses this picture.

218
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Now, maybe I was a little j uses this picture.

219
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,800
Now, maybe I was a little j uses this picture.

220
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
Now, maybe I was a little j uses this picture.

221
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,200
How can I grow my hair?

222
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,100
I don't grow my hair just because I want to grow my hair.

223
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,880
That's why I got hair extensions.

224
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:19,440
But it hurts when I get hair extensions.

225
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,340
Then, P.E.O.N.

226
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:31,000
Can you wait for me to grow my hair long?

227
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,480
P.E.O.N, you've never done an album promotion with long hair.

228
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,480
Oh, my God. You're right.

229
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,080
Oh, my God. Don't try to fool me.

230
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,080
I suddenly want to do an album promotion with long hair.

231
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:57,080
I'll wait for you. I really want to do an album promotion with long hair.

232
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,080
I'll wait for you. I really want to do an album promotion with long hair.

233
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
I'll wait for you. Really?

234
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,360
I really want to grow my hair long.

235
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,360
But it's going to take a few years.

236
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,360
Short hair is perfect for you.

237
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,360
Wait a minute, P.E.O.N.

238
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,360
Let's unify.

239
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,360
Let's unify. P.E.O.N, let's unify.

240
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,360
Can you wait for me?

241
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,360
Grow your hair first.

242
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,360
Okay.

243
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,360
I want to grow my hair long, too.

244
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,360
Did you fall in love with short hair?

245
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
Oh, my God.

246
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,640
Short hair is right.

247
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,640
I'll do anything.

248
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,640
You like everything, P.E.O.N.

249
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,640
Tell me you like everything.

250
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,640
All right.

251
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,640
All right.

252
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,640
I'll decide now.

253
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,920
I've heard a lot about P.E.O.N.

254
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,920
I'm going to think about it a lot.

255
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:40,920
I'll think of a way to satisfy both long and short hair.

256
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,920
Other members?

257
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,920
I think the other members are resting or sleeping in their rooms.

258
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,920
I caught a cold.

259
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,920
I think your voice caught a cold.

260
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
I didn't catch a cold.

261
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,200
It's my voice.

262
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,200
P.E.O.N, you scored a goal in Korea.

263
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Congratulations.

264
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
What about playing soccer?

265
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,920
Can you speak English for me?

266
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,920
Yes.

267
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,920
Of course.

268
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,920
ASMR?

269
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,920
ASMR?

270
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,920
How is it?

271
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,920
This sound.

272
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
My evil sorry.

273
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,920
Man.

274
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,920
My evil sorry.

275
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,920
My evil...

276
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,920
Yes, it's good.

277
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
Me?

278
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,920
Chaewon, do you watch it on Black and White?

279
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
I watched it on Black and White.

280
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,920
I watched it all.

281
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,920
But I think you're really amazing.

282
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,920
How can you cook like that?

283
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,920
I mean, it's amazing that you're so good at cooking,

284
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,920
but when I saw the ingredients,

285
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,920
I thought, I should cook this.

286
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,920
I should cook this new dish.

287
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
How did you come up with that idea?

288
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,920
I think it's a good idea.

289
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,920
I think it's a good idea.

290
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,920
I think it's a good idea.

291
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,920
I think it's a good idea.

292
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,920
How can I think of cooking something new?

293
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,920
I think you're amazing.

294
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,920
What's your favorite song from Sabrina Carpenter's songs?

295
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,920
Me?

296
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,920
There are so many.

297
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,920
There are so many. What do I do?

298
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,920
Among them...

299
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:14,920
I can't choose.

300
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:24,920
Ah, I'm hungry.

301
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:32,920
Let's make a big spoiler.

302
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,920
Just one.

303
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:42,920
I'm really sorry, but I don't have anything to spoil.

304
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,920
Ah, wait a minute.

305
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,920
Should I raise the ramen fire?

306
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,920
How about cooking ramen?

307
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,920
Don't do that.

308
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,920
I really don't eat.

309
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,920
If you do, you do.

310
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,920
If you don't, you don't.

311
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,920
It's too late now.

312
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:04,920
Because tomorrow is a little early.

313
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,920
Did I catch a cold?

314
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,920
Did Chaewon catch a cold?

315
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,920
Did I catch a cold?

316
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,920
Why? I didn't catch a cold.

317
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,920
Did I catch a cold?

318
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,920
Why is that?

319
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,920
What is it?

320
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,920
Is my voice weird?

321
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,920
Do you know the number of views when you cook ramen?

322
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,920
Don't say that.

323
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,920
I really don't eat.

324
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,920
My voice is weird?

325
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,920
Oh, my God.

326
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:44,920
No, because I'm before I go to bed.

327
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
No, it's because I don't know your calm voice.

328
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,920
Right?

329
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,920
It's my voice.

330
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:56,920
I always talk in high tone.

331
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,920
Is that so?

332
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,920
Can you turn on the camera?

333
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,920
I'm sorry.

334
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:08,920
I'm not ready for my face right now.

335
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,920
Chaewon, can I propose to you if I run into you by chance?

336
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,920
Please do.

337
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:26,920
Then I think it'll be a really good memory.

338
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,920
Oh, and I really have something on my mind.

339
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:38,920
Someone recognized me at the airport when I went on a family trip.

340
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,920
Someone recognized me at the airport.

341
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,920
She followed me.

342
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,920
I was walking with my mom and sister.

343
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,920
I was walking with my sister.

344
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,920
She hit me and said,

345
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,920
Are you Kim Chaewon?

346
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:04,920
I was the first person to recognize her when she started her trip.

347
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,920
I was so embarrassed.

348
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,920
I said, No, I'm sorry.

349
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,920
I went to her.

350
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,920
It's obviously me.

351
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,920
So I want to call her.

352
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,920
Actually, I was Kim Chaewon.

353
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,920
I'm sorry.

354
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,920
I was so surprised.

355
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,920
I lied because I was so surprised.

356
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,920
That's what I thought.

357
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,920
I'm sure she came to me with courage.

358
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,920
I said no, but she just left.

359
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,920
That hurt my heart more.

360
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:52,920
So I was right.

361
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:06,920
Please recommend a drama or movie that Chaewon picked.

362
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,920
Do you know the movie, Moonlight?

363
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,920
You're watching it again.

364
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:18,920
I used to watch it a lot of fun.

365
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,920
I used to watch it a lot of fun.

366
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:28,920
The feeling I saw then and the atmosphere.

367
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,920
The content is really fun.

368
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,920
That's right.

369
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,920
It's really fun.

370
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,920
The content is really crazy.

371
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,920
That's really sad, right?

372
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,920
That's right. It's hard because it's sad.

373
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,920
The last one.

374
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,920
It's so much fun.

375
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,920
I'm watching it again.

376
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,920
I fall asleep when I hear your voice.

377
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,920
Is that a good thing?

378
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,920
It's a good thing, right?

379
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,920
Do I have to do this?

380
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,920
Radio or something like that?

381
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,920
No, there's a voice live.

382
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,920
I'll turn on the voice live often.

383
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,920
Let's count sheep.

384
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,920
I don't count sheep.

385
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,920
When I can't sleep.

386
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,920
When I can't sleep.

387
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,920
I don't think there are many times when I can't sleep.

388
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,920
What do I do when I can't sleep?

389
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,920
I read books.

390
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,920
I fall asleep when I read books.

391
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,920
Is it because I keep writing my eyes like this?

392
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,920
Or is it because I fall asleep when I use my cell phone?

393
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,920
Is it because my eyes are tired?

394
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,920
I'm good at sleeping.

395
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,920
Do I fall asleep well even if I drink coffee?

396
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,960
I think I get a lot of sleep.

397
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,800
I don't drink that much coffee.

398
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,560
I'm lying down.

399
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,560
People keep asking me when I'm going to sleep.

400
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,560
I guess I'm sleepy.

401
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,760
I go to sleep when I'm sleepy.

402
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,480
You know you can get a good sleep when you're sleepy, right?

403
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,760
How are you doing these days, Chaeyeon?

404
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,160
You don't like me?

405
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,000
I don't listen to you.

406
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,880
Gemeinsam cool肶

407
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,880
Gemeinsam cool

408
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,440
Have you ever been bitten by Siro?

409
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,040
I've never been bitten by one before.

410
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,540
Chae-won, please tell me the combination of Yo-hwajeong.

411
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:11,440
I don't know the combination of Yo-hwajeong.

412
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,440
But I like fruit drinks.

413
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:22,440
Choco shell, choco pop, and fruit drink.

414
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,440
It's delicious no matter how you eat it.

415
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:33,440
What is Yo-hwajeong?

416
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,440
Oh, my God.

417
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,440
There's someone who's worse than me.

418
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,440
Chae-won, marry me.

419
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,440
Marry me.

420
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,440
What was this song?

421
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,440
I'm suddenly singing this song.

422
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,440
Oh, that's right.

423
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,440
Chae-won, I want to see the dance challenge.

424
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,440
Dance challenge?

425
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,440
Chae-won, do you already know that there are less than 90 days left this year?

426
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,440
No way.

427
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,440
Isn't time too fast?

428
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,440
When did the year go by so fast?

429
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,440
Isn't time too fast?

430
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,440
Why are you showing me this?

431
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,440
In 90 days, my sister will become an adult too?

432
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,440
You're right.

433
00:29:46,440 --> 00:30:15,740
Oh, time goes by so fast.

434
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:44,740
What I felt was that there was a piano that I had seen for a long time among the pianists, and there were pianists who just came in, and they were all so precious and thankful.

435
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:58,740
It's been about six years since I debuted in the entertainment industry.

436
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:26,740
So, the piano that I've been watching from the beginning, and the piano that you've been supporting me so far was really amazing.

437
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:43,740
Thank you so much.

438
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:23,740
It's been a long time since I've been with all the pianists.

439
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:34,740
If we stay together for a long time with all the pianists, we're going to fall in love.

440
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:39,740
It's a big deal if we don't have each other anymore.

441
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:14,740
I'm going to do it until I'm 50 years old.

442
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,740
Oh, yes.

443
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:26,740
I'll do my best until I'm 50 years old.

444
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:39,740
I work out a lot and eat a lot of nutrients, so I'll do it until I'm 50 years old.

445
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,740
I'm 50 years old.

446
00:33:43,740 --> 00:34:07,740
Can you give me a few lessons?

447
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,740
Oh, that was amazing, too.

448
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:14,740
There's a friend who's been liking me for a long time.

449
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:18,740
I was a pianist, and he was a pianist, too.

450
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:36,740
We grew up together, and it was so amazing to find out what kind of job he had and what kind of company he was in.

451
00:34:36,740 --> 00:35:01,740
It was so much fun to hear the stories of each pianist at the company.

452
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:20,740
Can I look forward to Golden Wave? Please look forward to it.

453
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:40,740
Shall we go to bed now?

454
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,740
I'll go to bed now.

455
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,740
Oh, no.

456
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:51,740
Why? No, it's because it's late.

457
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,740
It's just before midnight.

458
00:35:53,740 --> 00:36:01,740
This is like someone's planning, right?

459
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,740
Is it 12 o'clock?

460
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:11,740
It's late, because it's the next day.

461
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:38,740
I'm sorry, but it's time to sleep.

462
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,740
It's early, isn't it?

463
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,740
That's right.

464
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:58,740
It's the earliest time.

465
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,740
Chaeyeon, hurry up.

466
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:04,740
It's not dinner yet.

467
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,740
It's early in the morning.

468
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:14,740
You have to wake up and eat.

469
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,740
It's starting now.

470
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,740
Oh, my.

471
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:25,740
I'm the scariest.

472
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:31,740
Amechu?

473
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,740
Amechu?

474
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:36,740
In the morning...

475
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,740
Oh, bagel?

476
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:16,740
Bagel.

477
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:20,740
Ssambap.

478
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:23,740
There's only ssambap on my stomach right now.

479
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:28,740
London bagel looks delicious.

480
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:34,740
Lemon.

481
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,740
I don't like bagels.

482
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,740
I don't eat bagels.

483
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,740
Then I eat rice.

484
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:46,740
You don't really like bread, do you?

485
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,740
Recommend me a friend's taste.

486
00:38:48,740 --> 00:39:05,740
The ginger that came out this time was really good.

487
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:20,740
But the comments got faster.

488
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:26,740
I don't like bagels.

489
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:33,740
What? It's greasy.

490
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:39,740
Thank you.

491
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,740
Thank you. Thank you.

492
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:45,740
Don't get hurt.

493
00:39:45,740 --> 00:40:09,740
I'm kidding.

494
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:14,740
Then I'll go to bed.

495
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,740
Why?

496
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:27,740
I'm really early tomorrow.

497
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,740
The person who sleeps from now on is a fool.

498
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:36,740
Then I'll be a fool.

499
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:44,740
You did a great job today.

500
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:48,740
Let's all be fools together.

501
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,740
Let's be fools.

502
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:59,740
If you sleep now, you'll be happy tomorrow.

503
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,740
If you sleep now, you'll sleep well.

504
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:12,740
I'm in good condition, so I don't regret it tomorrow.

505
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,740
Bye bye.

506
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,740
See you next time.

507
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:23,740
Bye bye.

508
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,740
I'll really go.

509
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,740
Bye bye.
