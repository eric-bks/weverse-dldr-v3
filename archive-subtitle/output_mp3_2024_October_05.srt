00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,000
Hi

2
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:24,367
Hi

3
00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:29,933
Hi

4
00:00:31,767 --> 00:00:36,200
Hello, hello. Hi. What is it?

5
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:41,467
Is it me? Hi, hi.

6
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:51,667
The title of the song is
called Self-Strike. I'm just

7
00:00:51,733 --> 00:00:56,200
going to play before I go
to bed because I'm bored.

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,633
If you have any questions for me,
please ask me. I'll answer them all.

9
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:11,633
I'm nervous. I was just wondering
if you had any questions for me.

10
00:01:15,133 --> 00:01:20,133
It's not Eunchae's voice.
Whose voice is it then? It's mine.

11
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:26,033
What are you doing
now? I washed up.

12
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,033
I finished everything
and lay down.

13
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:36,567
How tall are you now? 170 cm? But I
don't think I'm tall anymore. I don't know.

14
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:40,367
Eunchae, are you sleeping
late today? I'm not sleeping late.

15
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:45,967
Fireworks? I didn't see it.

16
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,633
I saw it in the video.

17
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,633
TMI?

18
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:59,300
I feel good because I
scrubbed my body today.

19
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,567
What are you guys doing?

20
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:13,700
Do you see all the Fearnot
faces on the concert stage?

21
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:16,967
I can't see all
the Fearnot. But,

22
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:22,300
I think I can see almost
all the Fearnot on the floor.

23
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,600
Please sing me a crazy song.

24
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:29,300
"My answer is make
me super CRAZY".

25
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:31,067
Where are you?

26
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:32,633
I'm at home.

27
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:36,933
How was Daegu? The makchang
(beef last viscous) was really good.

28
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:39,167
Eunchae, did you catch a cold?

29
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:42,033
I didn't catch a cold.

30
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,633
Isn't it because it's been a
long time since I did a voice live?

31
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,167
Do you want me to give you a
spoiler? What kind of spoiler?

32
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:52,500
I didn't catch a cold.

33
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,600
This is where they are loverly.

34
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:07,633
급등 고 벽 수트 대우 레먼 했는데 너무 죄송 했다.

35
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,300
While studying.

36
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:19,500
Crazy next song?

37
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:20,567
Hey

38
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,800
Crazy next time.

39
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:28,467
Dialect?

40
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:34,933
It's hard

41
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,100
Japanese?

42
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:43,900
Today, too.

43
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,100
Fearnot...

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,033
Today, too.

45
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,033
Fan signing.

46
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:07,033
Thank you for coming.

47
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,467
Am I right?

48
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:09,533
I don't know.

49
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,800
Isn't it Eunchae ssi?

50
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:13,500
Eunchae ssi.

51
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:16,833
I'm going to make you laugh.

52
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,500
Eunchae ssi.

53
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:21,067
I did it first.

54
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:23,267
I won.

55
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,433
Crazy Red.

56
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,033
Back in the days.

57
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,567
The me that fell short of crazy

58
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:35,433
I will no longer bear false
witness before my attraction

59
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,100
A word in Japanese for Kkura.

60
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:40,400
Good night.

61
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,267
Birthday?

62
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,400
Who's birthday is it today?

63
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,167
Today, Nolto's Crazy came out?

64
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:51,667
Why?

65
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:53,067
I can't believe I'm writing.

66
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,100
It's not hard.

67
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:08,100
Oh, really?

68
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:10,633
Yoonjin Ah's part?

69
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,300
Where?

70
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:18,000
"Renewed the neuronal system
Broke out of the prison in my head"

71
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,300
Oh, here it is.

72
00:05:22,633 --> 00:05:25,233
I ate meat today. But I
suddenly want to eat cherries.

73
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,033
I suddenly want to eat cherries.

74
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,033
I wanted to eat cherries.

75
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,100
I ordered cherries just now.

76
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:46,933
Is this a secret live broadcast?

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,100
Secret live broadcast? No, I
don't do it secretly. Be confident.

78
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,600
You said you were going
to sleep. I ordered cherries.

79
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:05,100
No, I'm going to play with Fearnot,
eat some cherries, and go to bed.

80
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,033
Ferrari girl

81
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,033
What? Who is this?

82
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,100
Why am I Ferrari girl?

83
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,233
You don't cry and you talk well.

84
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:47,700
Cafe

85
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,033
Ferrari girl

86
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,100
I can't buy a Ferrari, everyone.

87
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:03,467
I'm watching 초순지야 꼿티요 right now.

88
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,033
It's a little behind the scenes.

89
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:15,100
I'm watching it.

90
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:23,300
I know it's a lot.

91
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,033
That's right. That's a lot.

92
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,033
I know.

93
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,100
I didn't see the
Culinary Class Wars.

94
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:38,033
Culinary Class Wars

95
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,600
I don't know. They
say it's so much fun.

96
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:46,033
All the members around
me say it's so much fun.

97
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,533
They're all talking about it.

98
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,533
They're copying it.

99
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,533
And if I say I
haven't seen it yet,

100
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,533
You're still happy.

101
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,533
That's what they're saying.

102
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,533
I thought it was a
cooking and judging show.

103
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,533
I haven't seen it yet.

104
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,533
I'm not interested in it yet.

105
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,600
I've seen The Queen of Tears.

106
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,333
Eunchae sings: Touch.

107
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,533
So cute.

108
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,533
The comments are so cute.

109
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
Eunchae sings: Touch.

110
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Eunchae, please teach me
how to speak English well.

111
00:09:02,267 --> 00:09:03,600
I don't know.

112
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,800
Please.

113
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:08,867
Me, too.

114
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,567
Sing me a celebrity.

115
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:27,900
But when I was on
a celebrity stage,

116
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,767
I wrote the lyrics and sang it.

117
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:34,567
Something like this.

118
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:37,000
I sang it in the lyrics.

119
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:38,233
So...

120
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,567
But originally, I
didn't know the song.

121
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:43,633
The original lyrics.

122
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:45,567
I don't remember.

123
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:46,633
So...

124
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,533
That's what it was.

125
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:14,767
Smart.

126
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:19,567
Hong Eunchae

127
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:20,933
Do you like General Hong Yi?

128
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,367
It was my nickname when
I was in elementary school.

129
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,733
What is your nickname?

130
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,400
I sang it two times in one part.

131
00:10:30,467 --> 00:10:32,567
Why didn't you make me sing
when you just sang a part again?

132
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,767
I borrowed it.

133
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:40,067
Hong Hee-jung, Hong-sam,
Hong-gil-dong, something like that.

134
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,500
You know, right?

135
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,433
Speak Chinese, please.

136
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,367
Thank you. I love you.

137
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:54,400
See you in China.

138
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:02,933
Please come to Jeola
Yume de kiss me.

139
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,500
Yume de kiss me

140
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:05,933
Is this right?

141
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,633
Your lover...??

142
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:10,500
Yume de kiss me

143
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:11,633
Is this right?

144
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,267
Yume de kiss me

145
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,833
Na na na kiss me.

146
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:19,867
Watashi tu ru

147
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:22,133
Oso jo shi

148
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,800
Actually, I don't
know the lyrics.

149
00:11:26,133 --> 00:11:29,633
Na na na

150
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,233
Please, please.

151
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,533
Yume de kiss me

152
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:39,600
I want you to wish me a
happy birthday in Japanese.

153
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:42,000
Happy birthday!

154
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:43,467
Nemo Nemo, Nemo Nemo sign.

155
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:45,533
Nemo Nemo, Nemo Nemo.

156
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:48,533
Bonchae Manchae

157
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:56,567
It's not a content if I sing.

158
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:02,467
Where the heck is Saki?

159
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:22,367
You're not ready to sleep soon?

160
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:24,367
Not yet.

161
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:27,100
It's not that bad yet.

162
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:29,433
I'm turning lights
on in my room.

163
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,367
What's your favorite
nickname these days?

164
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:45,367
I'm Hoonchae.

165
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:47,833
Hoonchae. Hoonchae
Hong Hoonchae.

166
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:55,733
Hoonchae.

167
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:58,100
Who made that?

168
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:01,567
I think it's well
made. Did you like it?

169
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,667
Hoon High School?

170
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:05,733
Do you call it Hoon High School?

171
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,367
Oh, it's not Daehari.

172
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:09,433
No, I'm sorry.

173
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:12,900
Daehari isn't my nickname.

174
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,800
Hoonni like Eunchae?

175
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:19,900
No.

176
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,733
It's Hoon Hoon Ha Eunchae.

177
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,800
Isn't it?

178
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:25,367
It's Hoon Hoon High School because
it's Hoon Hoon High School, right?

179
00:13:25,433 --> 00:13:27,433
Hoonie Eunchae?

180
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:29,967
Are you making fun of me?

181
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,033
Hoon High School
student Eunchae.

182
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:40,033
Hoon High School
to the training center?

183
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,367
What are you talking about?

184
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:42,667
Don't say anything.

185
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:48,233
It's Hoona~.

186
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,533
It's not Hoon Hoon High School?

187
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:52,400
Do you have a hobby these days?

188
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:53,633
Is it Hoon Hoon?

189
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:55,100
Oh, really?

190
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,367
Is it not Hoon Hoon-han?

191
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:57,433
I'm not sure.

192
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:01,367
Do you have a hobby these days?

193
00:14:01,433 --> 00:14:02,533
Did you do anything?

194
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,400
치미는.

195
00:14:05,633 --> 00:14:06,633
시몬.

196
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,467
I miss you, Eunchae.
I miss you, too.

197
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:26,433
I miss you, too.

198
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,733
How can you remember that there
are three nail clubs in your nickname?

199
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:41,033
Favorite manhwa? I
don't watch manhwa often.

200
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:51,600
Ah, Wait a minute. Say
something to the unnies

201
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:53,833
who bought white hoodies
because of Eunchae.

202
00:14:55,267 --> 00:15:00,033
What is this? Really.
What is this? What is it?

203
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:05,933
What should I do?

204
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,567
At that time, that white hoodie unnie was
really awesome. I could only see that unni.

205
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,433
It's really funny.

206
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,367
Did you really buy
a white hoodie?

207
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:22,633
Oh, really.

208
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,567
It's not a plotting.

209
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:30,433
Are you crazy? Are you crazy?

210
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,433
Why? Why? What?

211
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:39,433
To be exact, it's not white.

212
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:43,433
Why did you buy a
bright gray hoodie?

213
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:47,367
It's not white.

214
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:48,600
The bright gray one.

215
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,067
You know what ash is, right?

216
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,733
자세이 높았네.
(?) The posture was high.

217
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,367
I didn't look closely, but
that girl was sitting in a row.

218
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,833
It's not a plotting,
it's really...

219
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,433
Everyone, I'll
explain what it is.

220
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:33,367
Don't say anything
and listen. I'll explain.

221
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:39,433
Do you want me to say
something? I'll explain.

222
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,067
It's been a long time
since we had a university

223
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:48,233
event, and there were
schools that went far away.

224
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,567
We're on stage,

225
00:16:53,633 --> 00:16:58,867
but we've gained a lot
of good energy and a lot of good things.

226
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:02,367
We prepared our autographed
albums for each school.

227
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:06,200
I wanted to pick someone
who enjoyed it so much and

228
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:10,433
give them a gift, so I prepared
an autographed album.

229
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:15,700
So now, it's time to pick the person
to give the autographed album.

230
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:21,200
So, at that time,
the signed album,

231
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:23,400
Whoever shows the most love

232
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:29,367
But I'm not lying.

233
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:34,533
I'm going to start the anti fans

234
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,533
There was a person who caught my eye from
the moment I took the first pose.

235
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:45,167
But now that there are so many
people, it was really hard for us to

236
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:49,300
pick two or three people
for this autographed album.

237
00:17:50,533 --> 00:17:53,400
So it's really hard to choose.

238
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:54,400
Oh, I'm really...

239
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:59,567
From the moment I came on
stage, they were so eye-catching.

240
00:17:59,633 --> 00:18:00,400
I took a hard-core picture.

241
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:03,867
Because the people
were so cute in front of me.

242
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:08,600
What should I do when there are
so many people around me?

243
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:17,367
And when I say a word that suits
this song, I have nothing against it.

244
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:18,633
I'm sorry.

245
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,700
I'm sorry.

246
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,933
Are you jealous?

247
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,533
Hey,

248
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,800
don't be jealous.

249
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,400
Oh, I'm going crazy.

250
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:39,700
And it's a college festival, so if you're
a college student, you're older than me.

251
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:43,400
And the fact that I'm in
the first row means that

252
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:46,633
I'm the unnie of
my student at the school.

253
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,633
And I have a lot
of affection for you.

254
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:15,867
Guys, let's talk
about something else.

255
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:26,133
I wanted to treat you gently
rather than affectionately.

256
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,600
Also,

257
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:32,833
It's a fun atmosphere and
we're all of the same age.

258
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,133
I wanted to treat you gently.

259
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,533
Wemo Check!

260
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:02,767
???

261
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:11,700
Are you joining the (공육주) public
offering club? Public offering club?

262
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:15,533
Public offering club? Public offering
club... Don't you have any friends?

263
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:38,067
Turn it off?

264
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:42,300
Turn it off? That's it.

265
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
It's an October's birthday.

266
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:08,733
It's October 27th.

267
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,733
Congratulations.

268
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,800
Congratulations, Miri.

269
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,000
Are you listening?

270
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,967
Congratulations, Miri.

271
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,800
It's still October.

272
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
Although it's the 5th.

273
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,800
There are a lot of
birthdays when it's cold.

274
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,733
Congratulations, everyone.

275
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
Do you have a
challenge you want to do?

276
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,733
Do you have a
challenge you want to do?

277
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
A challenge you want to do?

278
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I want to do a touch.

279
00:21:59,433 --> 00:22:01,433
I want to do a touch challenge.

280
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:04,733
What are the
challenges these days?

281
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,733
But not the dance
challenges of other groups.

282
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,800
What's the challenge that's
really popular these days?

283
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,800
Nemo, Nemo, Nemo, Nemo.

284
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,100
Is my mom good at this?

285
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:37,800
Good night

286
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:40,167
Entertainer?

287
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:47,800
What did you say?

288
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:49,767
What is Umbrini?

289
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,700
Back in the day challenge?

290
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:23,467
A lot of people asked me to do that.

291
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:33,100
Emergency ara ara

292
00:24:07,767 --> 00:24:08,933
It's going to be cut off?

293
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,433
I wasn't talking yet.

294
00:24:19,267 --> 00:24:20,800
The weather is really nice.

295
00:24:21,933 --> 00:24:23,800
The weather is nice.

296
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,800
What movie do you recommend?

297
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:36,800
For me, Inside Out and...

298
00:24:39,233 --> 00:24:43,800
It's not serious at all.

299
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,600
It's a cute and fun movie.

300
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:51,600
There's a movie called Yes Day.

301
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,333
Was it when I was
in elementary school?

302
00:24:56,333 --> 00:25:00,800
It's a movie that my teacher showed me
in class when I was in elementary school.

303
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:07,733
My family went...

304
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,733
Once a year?

305
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,733
So we decided on Yes Day.

306
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,733
So on that day, we
can always say yes.

307
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,733
We can only say yes.

308
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,733
On that day.

309
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,800
So...

310
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,733
So once a year, once a day,

311
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,733
There are things I
really wanted to do.

312
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,800
There are things I
can't even imagine.

313
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:30,967
Buying ice cream for each taste.

314
00:25:31,033 --> 00:25:32,800
Eating ice cream for each taste.

315
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:35,333
It's a day like that.

316
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:37,733
Because I can only say yes.

317
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,167
I have to follow everything.

318
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:43,733
Anyway, there's a
lot of movies like that.

319
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,267
So it's just cute.

320
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,733
It's not really serious.

321
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,933
Just...

322
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
What should I say?

323
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:52,167
Just once.

324
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
When I'm bored?

325
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:56,633
It's quiet

326
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,733
It looks fun. When
I close my eyes?

327
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
I can sleep in peace.

328
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,567
Do you like croissant?

329
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:09,800
Yes, I like it.

330
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:16,967
Vacation story?

331
00:26:18,133 --> 00:26:21,800
Vacation story?

332
00:26:22,633 --> 00:26:25,800
I think Fearnot already
knows about my vacation.

333
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:30,600
On Friday, I did the
last time with Weverse.

334
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:34,967
Most of all, I went
to the baseball field.

335
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,467
The article was so good

336
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,700
I was surprised.

337
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,833
I'm just like...

338
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,533
But still, the same,
the same as other

339
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,233
I got the ticket,

340
00:26:55,933 --> 00:26:59,067
I didn't think I'd be able to get a lot of

341
00:26:59,133 --> 00:27:02,200
sightings while I was
on my way to the concert.

342
00:27:02,267 --> 00:27:05,800
But I didn't know there would
be so many articles about me.

343
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:09,600
I was so embarrassed.

344
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:14,067
I'm really bad at self-makeup.

345
00:27:18,267 --> 00:27:20,700
But I won the day.

346
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,567
But the weather was really
nice and it was so much fun.

347
00:27:34,233 --> 00:27:42,233
And I just went to the beach with
my mom and brother to get some air.

348
00:27:43,867 --> 00:27:45,400
With my mom and my brother...

349
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,433
So I went to the
beach to get some air.

350
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:52,600
And I did it with my brother.

351
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:57,400
I did a lot of things, but my
brother was really bad at it.

352
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,900
So I won everything.

353
00:27:59,967 --> 00:28:03,367
And I filmed it in
time-lapse mode.

354
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:07,600
I filmed it in fast-forward
mode, and it's so funny.

355
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:08,867
It's so funny.

356
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:14,333
And what else?

357
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,933
I just met a lot of
family members.

358
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:27,400
Other than my mom, dad, and my brother,
I've met a lot of relatives this time.

359
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:32,167
There are family members that
I see often,

360
00:28:32,233 --> 00:28:36,333
but there are also people that I
haven't seen in years.

361
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,800
It's really been a year.

362
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:41,833
And you're the first
person I've seen on TV.

363
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,933
I think I've met a lot
of family members.

364
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:51,067
The moon photo was
at the beach in Sokcho.

365
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:56,367
On the way home from Sokcho, I
took a really cool picture of the moon.

366
00:28:57,333 --> 00:29:01,600
I also played bowling.

367
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:09,667
Me, Eunchae, Eunchae's brother, 1st
cousin, 2nd cousin, and I played bowling.

368
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:14,700
Was it fun?

369
00:29:18,533 --> 00:29:21,900
Screen baseball. I
played screen baseball.

370
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:24,500
It was fun. Screen baseball.

371
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:30,867
Do you have a favorite
baseball cheering song?

372
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:35,500
I sang along to all of them.

373
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:41,500
But I forgot to go.

374
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:44,033
I forgot.

375
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:51,567
Favorite? I just
like all of them.

376
00:30:10,533 --> 00:30:11,533
You know all of them.

377
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,600
Fearnot, how do you know?

378
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:43,533
It's been a long time
since I exercised.

379
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,533
I exercised before the vacation.

380
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,533
I exercised after the vacation.

381
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,600
I exercised because
I didn't do anything.

382
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,800
I exercised a lot
when I was a trainee.

383
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:12,300
It's really hard to start over,

384
00:31:12,367 --> 00:31:15,200
But I want you to try it.

385
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,467
I want to go to the beach again.

386
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:48,800
I want to go again.

387
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,667
I want to go to the
baseball field again.

388
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,000
It's a shame, but I really
have to go next year.

389
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,433
Really, on that day,

390
00:32:20,467 --> 00:32:21,533
It was so awesome.

391
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
It was a fun game.

392
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:31,667
The weather was good, it was
interesting, and it was a fun game.

393
00:32:34,033 --> 00:32:35,933
The seaweed soup
was really good, too.

394
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,367
Did you take a selfie
at the baseball field?

395
00:33:01,433 --> 00:33:03,100
I posted it on Instagram.

396
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:18,133
Wow, 30 minutes have passed.

397
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:21,567
Wow.

398
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,100
It was Friday yesterday.

399
00:33:31,267 --> 00:33:34,567
But it's been so long
since I've done another

400
00:33:34,633 --> 00:33:37,167
schedule for the first time on Friday.

401
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,400
I'm a little...

402
00:33:40,967 --> 00:33:42,967
I had no choice but to...

403
00:33:43,767 --> 00:33:46,233
I felt a little bit sad.

404
00:33:47,633 --> 00:33:49,967
I think it was the
same for Fearnot.

405
00:33:51,733 --> 00:33:53,733
I just came to play today.

406
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:02,333
Did you have fun?

407
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,533
The rider said he
started delivering.

408
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:51,533
Oh, the Japanese
I've learned recently.

409
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,700
I always forget and always...

410
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:58,900
Fans asked me so much about
the Japanese I've learned recently.

411
00:34:58,967 --> 00:35:00,333
I...

412
00:35:00,967 --> 00:35:02,433
Now I'm trying to memorize
the Japanese that I've

413
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,067
learned recently while
talking with my unnies.

414
00:35:04,133 --> 00:35:08,667
I try to memorize it and
when I ask again later,

415
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:14,400
I say I should answer
like this at that time.

416
00:35:14,467 --> 00:35:17,867
Oh, but I really forgot again.

417
00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:19,333
I learned... Oh,
there was something.

418
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,033
Do you know what is the
Japanese word for water crab?

419
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,100
Guys?

420
00:35:25,067 --> 00:35:26,933
Water crab. It was a water crab.

421
00:35:27,933 --> 00:35:29,300
What is a water crab?

422
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:30,833
That... Oh, really. What was it?

423
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,067
I always remember this
when it's really dark.

424
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:34,067
I remember, I
remember, I remember.

425
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:35,367
I do this, but...

426
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:37,200
Wa... wata ame?

427
00:35:37,267 --> 00:35:39,133
Wata

428
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:46,133
It's not a water crab.

429
00:35:47,233 --> 00:35:48,233
Mijino?

430
00:35:50,033 --> 00:35:51,067
Water dog?

431
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:52,133
No, it's not.

432
00:35:54,233 --> 00:35:54,767
Ajarashi.

433
00:35:54,833 --> 00:36:00,767
I think it was ajarashi.

434
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:01,833
That's right.

435
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:03,833
Thank you.

436
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,767
Anyway, I think it was ajarashi.

437
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:16,767
What's your favorite
snack these days?

438
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:20,467
I really like fried rice cakes
and nurungji these days.

439
00:36:20,533 --> 00:36:21,767
Nurungji.

440
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:24,867
I like nurungji and
fried rice cakes.

441
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:25,867
Fried rice cakes.

442
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:31,067
Yesterday, my manager bought
me a really delicious fried rice cake.

443
00:36:32,533 --> 00:36:34,600
It was really delicious.

444
00:36:35,233 --> 00:36:41,967
That's what me and the other
manager and two people...

445
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,267
The long bag...

446
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:47,367
You usually sell
that long bag like this.

447
00:36:47,433 --> 00:36:49,333
I ate it all.

448
00:36:50,433 --> 00:36:51,967
I ate it all on the spot.

449
00:36:54,233 --> 00:36:55,867
It's not a human
fried rice cake.

450
00:36:55,933 --> 00:36:56,567
It's not a human
fried rice cake.

451
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:57,467
It's really...

452
00:36:57,533 --> 00:36:59,467
It melts in your mouth.

453
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:00,667
It melts when you
put it in your mouth.

454
00:37:00,733 --> 00:37:01,867
It's really thin.

455
00:37:01,933 --> 00:37:03,867
It's really sweet and savory.

456
00:37:03,933 --> 00:37:05,300
It was really delicious.

457
00:37:09,367 --> 00:37:11,300
Anyway, that's it, everyone.

458
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:12,367
Are you doing well?

459
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,867
Isn't it almost 12 o'clock?

460
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:18,233
It's almost 12 o'clock.

461
00:37:18,933 --> 00:37:20,367
You should sleep.

462
00:37:20,433 --> 00:37:22,167
Eunchae, I'm going to bed.

463
00:37:22,233 --> 00:37:23,233
Yeah.

464
00:37:24,267 --> 00:37:25,867
All right.

465
00:37:25,933 --> 00:37:26,867
What are you doing?

466
00:37:26,933 --> 00:37:29,167
Of course, I'm going to eat
cherries before I go to bed.

467
00:37:37,433 --> 00:37:42,467
I'm going to eat cherries before I go to
bed, but you guys should go to bed early.

468
00:37:43,767 --> 00:37:44,733
All right?

469
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,067
Did you have fun today?

470
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,867
I guess the
cherries are all here.

471
00:37:50,933 --> 00:37:51,367
That's right.

472
00:37:51,433 --> 00:37:52,467
We're almost there.

473
00:37:53,933 --> 00:37:54,867
Bye.

474
00:37:54,933 --> 00:37:56,867
Did you have fun today?

475
00:37:56,933 --> 00:37:57,867
Good night.

476
00:37:57,933 --> 00:37:58,867
Have a good dream.

477
00:37:58,933 --> 00:37:59,867
Bye bye.

478
00:37:59,933 --> 00:38:00,933
I'll be back.

479
00:38:02,433 --> 00:38:03,433
Bye.

480
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:05,233
Bye, Chu.
