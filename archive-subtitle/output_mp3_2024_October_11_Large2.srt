1
00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:13,533


2
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,980
Hello?

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,300
Are you there?

4
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:22,934


5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,880
Hi

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,100
Hello, hello

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,040
Hello

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,820
Ah, hello

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hi

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I dropped my phone

11
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:44,352
On my face!

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's night so I should be quiet

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I dropped my phone on my face

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This big Galaxy

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Unnie, I finished my schedule

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I washed and lay down

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I was so bored

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So I turned it on

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Samuachi

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
In Japanese, Samuachi

21
00:01:29,574 --> 00:01:30,574


22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Good night

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What did you do today?

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Today?

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I filmed all day

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
There was a filming

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
A story about vacation?

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I went on vacation

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I went to Nha Trang with my family

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But they recognized me

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Because it was a vacation

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And it was a holiday

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,787
So most of the Koreans

34
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:04,993
Most of the Koreans

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Most of the Koreans were Koreans

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Those who came on a vacation

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So many people recognized me

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
They called me a fan

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Because I was uncomfortable

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
When I was eating

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
When I was eating?

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
They didn't pretend to know

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
At the end, when we got a seat

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
They said, I'm a fan

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And left

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I was so thankful

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That little consideration

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I was thankful

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I was so happy

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Because they called me a fan

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,900
And what was it?

53
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,040
A fan who took me on a vacation

54
00:02:57,963 --> 00:02:59,553
I wanted to go on a vacation

55
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:01,932


56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And hang out with them

57
00:03:04,429 --> 00:03:04,792


58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
A lot

59
00:03:10,068 --> 00:03:12,900
Like a water play

60
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:14,153
But until that time

61
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,978
It's overseas

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Because it's foreign

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I was like this

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
With you

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Really

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I really care about nothing

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:36,500
I just walked around like that, but in front of me, there were a lot of tourists, and they were calling me from the boat.

68
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:43,560
Oh, I'll be so embarrassed.

69
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,680
Oh, so, wow. Oh, please, this is, oh, this is.

70
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:57,920
Thank you so much for recognizing me, but if you took a picture, I really hope you don't post this.

71
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,880
That's what I thought, but they didn't post it. Thank you.

72
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,520
I think they saw it, too. Oh, this is Jaewon.

73
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,800
I don't think I should post it for that.

74
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:19,127
Please take care of me personally.

75
00:04:19,494 --> 00:04:34,078
Yes. Please take care of me personally.

76
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,520
I'm drunk after eating Jinbin.

77
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,320
Huh? I'm drunk after eating Jinbin?

78
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,120
How much did you drink?

79
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,520
You can't drink well.

80
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,520
Jaewon, what did you eat for dinner?

81
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,760
I think I'm going to get in trouble from Fianna, but I didn't eat dinner.

82
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,160
What's the sound of a motorcycle?

83
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,560
I just opened the window in my room.

84
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,020
Can you even hear the sound of a motorcycle?

85
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,920
That's amazing.

86
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,320
Oh, it's whiskey now.

87
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,040
Oh, there's whiskey and highball.

88
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,520
I thought you were talking about highball.

89
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,320
It's good to drink whiskey.

90
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,880
It's good to drink whiskey.

91
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,120
It's good to drink whiskey.

92
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,220
How many cans of Jinbin can you drink?

93
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:39,200
I haven't counted it, but it's so delicious that it's going in.

94
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,380
It's delicious.

95
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,560
Isn't it really delicious?

96
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,360
I'm really satisfied with my job.

97
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:46,880
The best.

98
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,540
I'm really satisfied with my job.

99
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,240
I'm really satisfied with my job.

100
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,720
I'm really satisfied with my job.

101
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:02,940
Did you learn Japanese?

102
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,120
Did you learn Japanese?

103
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,180
Did you learn Japanese?

104
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,140
Then I should learn some foreign languages.

105
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,600
I되i

106
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,780
better to study English

107
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,600
I won't eat.

108
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,020
Can you tell me about what I learned today?

109
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,700
Yes, I'm going to talk about it.

110
00:06:27,193 --> 00:06:36,652
I don't know which is better, this or that hair.

111
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,720
I learned this.

112
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,479


113
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,720
So cute.

114
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:11,720
Japanese people always call me kawaii.

115
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,720
They call me kawaii when I'm shooting.

116
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,720
They call me kawaii when I'm playing piano.

117
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:40,720
Is it hot in Japan right now?

118
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Is it cold?

119
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,720
I'm going to Japan soon.

120
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,720
I forgot a lot of Japanese.

121
00:07:51,720 --> 00:08:00,720
I'm going to Japan soon.

122
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Is it cold?

123
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,001
It's cold in Korea, too.

124
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,682
Soon, soon.

125
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:09,967
Right, right.

126
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
I'm going to Japan soon.

127
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
I'm going to Japan soon.

128
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,720
How is the weather in Japan?

129
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
It's cold, right?

130
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
I got it.

131
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,720
Isn't the weather so nice right now?

132
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
I really like this weather.

133
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,720
It's a cool weather.

134
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,720
It's cold and hot at the same time.

135
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
It's so cold.

136
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,720
I can't read Chinese characters.

137
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,720
I can't hear you.

138
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Is it warm?

139
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
It's warmer than Korea.

140
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
It's not loud.

141
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
What did I say?

142
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,720
I'm Japanese.

143
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,720
I can speak Japanese because I have Japanese piano.

144
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
What?

145
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
I can.

146
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
I can't remember what it is.

147
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
I'm sorry.

148
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
What is it?

149
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,720
What?

150
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
What?

151
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
Recommend me a snack?

152
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,369
Hmm...

153
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,720
What would be good?

154
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,720
I really like ssambap these days

155
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
I had ssambap for lunch today

156
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
Was it for lunch?

157
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,720
I had ssambap

158
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,720
But these days, ssambap comes out so well

159
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
For delivery

160
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
So that you can eat it in one bite

161
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
I came here with ssambap

162
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,720
wrapped in ssambap

163
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,720
So it was so delicious

164
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,720
I want to sell a lot of ssambap

165
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
I want to sell a lot of ssambap

166
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,720
There aren't many places

167
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
There aren't many places

168
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,720
to deliver ssambap

169
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,720
I'm hungry

170
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
Before I sleep

171
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,720
I'm always hungry

172
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,720
Before I sleep

173
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,720
What's wrong?

174
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,720
Recommend songs to listen when studying

175
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,720
You only study when you study

176
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,720
Or

177
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,720
I can hear the sound that I can concentrate well.

178
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,720
What do you think?

179
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,720
Like ASMR?

180
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,720
Chaewon, what is the next hair color you want to do?

181
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:49,720
I want to do black hair or brown hair, not bleached hair.

182
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,720
I just happened to see a picture of me with long hair.

183
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,720
So I want to grow my hair.

184
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,720
But how can I grow my hair?

185
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,720
I can't grow my hair just because I want to grow it.

186
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,720
That's why I have hair extensions.

187
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,720
But it hurts when I have hair extensions.

188
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:30,720
Chaewon, can you wait for me to grow long hair with my own hair?

189
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
Can you wait for me to grow long hair with my own hair?

190
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,720
Chaewon, have you ever done an album with long hair?

191
00:12:48,194 --> 00:12:49,015


192
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
Oh, my God.

193
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,720
Oh, my God. Don't seduce me.

194
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,720
I suddenly want to grow long hair.

195
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,720
I'll be waiting for you. Really?

196
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,720
I really want to grow long hair with my own hair.

197
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Chaewon.

198
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,720
But it'll take a few years.

199
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,720
You look good with short hair.

200
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,720
Do you have short hair, too?

201
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,720
Wait a minute, Chaewon.

202
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,720
Let's unify.

203
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,720
Let's unify.

204
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,720
Chaewon, let's unify.

205
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,720
Can you wait for me to grow long hair with my own hair?

206
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,720
Grow it first.

207
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,720
All right.

208
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,720
I want to grow it, too.

209
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
Did you fall in love with short hair?

210
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,720
Oh, my God.

211
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
You're right about short hair.

212
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,720
I'll do anything.

213
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
You like everything, Chaewon.

214
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
Tell me you like everything.

215
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,720
All right.

216
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,720
All right.

217
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,720
Now I'll decide.

218
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,720
I've heard a lot of opinions from Chaewon.

219
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
I've been thinking about it a lot.

220
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:40,720
I'll figure out how to satisfy both long-haired and short-haired people.

221
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Other members...

222
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,720
Wouldn't the other members be resting or sleeping in their rooms?

223
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
Chaewon, you caught a cold.

224
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
I think your voice is sick.

225
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,720
I didn't catch a cold.

226
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,720
It's just my voice.

227
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Chaewon scored in Korean.

228
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720


229
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
Congratulations.

230
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
I'm going to play soccer.

231
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
I'm going to play soccer.

232
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,652
Can you speak English for me?

233
00:15:32,493 --> 00:15:33,720
Yes!

234
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,720
Of course!

235
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
ASMR?

236
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,720
How is it?

237
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,720
This sound?

238
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
My evil sorry

239
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,400
Man

240
00:16:33,357 --> 00:16:34,857


241
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
Yes it's good

242
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,720
Chae-Ver, how about please watch Black and White岩 guided film?

243
00:16:56,083 --> 00:17:02,326


244
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
I've watched it all

245
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,620
You've seen it all, right?

246
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,220
But I think you're really amazing.

247
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,420
How can you cook so well?

248
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:30,720
I mean, it's amazing that you're so good at cooking.

249
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,020
When I saw the ingredients, I thought,

250
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,820
Oh, I have to cook this.

251
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,520
I have to cook this new dish.

252
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,820
How can you think of that?

253
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,920
I think you're really, really amazing.

254
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,720
What's your favorite song of Sabrina Carpenter?

255
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,320
Me? There are so many.

256
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,520
But there are so many.

257
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,920
What should I do?

258
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,120
Among them.

259
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,920
I can't choose.

260
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,820
I'm hungry.

261
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,320
What kind of man is that?

262
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:34,764


263
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,100
You're the best

264
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,520
Hey, hang on.

265
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,420
Let's say.

266
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:44,720
I think I'm going to say it right now.

267
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,520
You.

268
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,020
Come on now.

269
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,220
There's no happiness.

270
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,320
What am I doing?

271
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:53,820
Can I機 shrink for a moment?

272
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,420
Hmph.

273
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,420
It's too late now.

274
00:18:58,372 --> 00:19:03,264


275
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,420
Because it's a little early tomorrow.

276
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,420
Did I catch a cold?

277
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,420
Chaewon asked if I caught a cold.

278
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,420
Did I catch a cold?

279
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,420
Why?

280
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,420
I didn't catch a cold.

281
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,420
Why is that?

282
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,420
Is my voice weird?

283
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,420
Do you get a lot of views when you cook ramen?

284
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,420
Don't say that.

285
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,420
I really don't eat ramen.

286
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,420
My voice is weird?

287
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,420
Oh my god.

288
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,420
Because I'm

289
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,420
It's because it's before I go to bed.

290
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,420
It's because I don't know your calm voice well.

291
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,420
Right?

292
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,420
It's my voice.

293
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,420
I always

294
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,420
I always speak in high tone.

295
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,420
I always speak in high tone.

296
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,420
Is that so?

297
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,420
Can you turn on the camera?

298
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,420
I'm sorry.

299
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,420
I'm not ready for my face right now.

300
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,420
I'm not ready for my face right now.

301
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,420
Chaewon, if you run into me by chance, can I propose to you?

302
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,420
Please do it.

303
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,420
I'll make good memories.

304
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,420
And

305
00:20:36,352 --> 00:20:40,352
When I went on a family trip,

306
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,420
An airport

307
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:44,346
Someone recognized me.

308
00:20:45,973 --> 00:20:48,352
Followed me.

309
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,420
I was walking with my sister.

310
00:20:50,488 --> 00:20:52,832
She put her hands on my face like this.

311
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,420
No, I'm sorry.

312
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,420
I went there, and it was me.

313
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,420
So I want to call him.

314
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,420
Actually, I was hit by Kim Chae Won.

315
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,420
I'm sorry.

316
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,420
I was so surprised.

317
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,420
I was so surprised that I lied.

318
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,420
That's what I thought.

319
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:35,420
I'm sure he came here with courage.

320
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,420
He said no, so he just left.

321
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,420
It hurt me more.

322
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,420
So...

323
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,420
That's right.

324
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,420
That's right.

325
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,420
I'm sorry.

326
00:22:06,113 --> 00:22:07,924


327
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:12,946


328
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:16,755
Kim Chae Won has also come into my life.

329
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:20,420
I used to watch it a lot of fun.

330
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,420
The content is really fun.

331
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,420
That's right.

332
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,420
The content is really crazy.

333
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,420
It's hard to be sad.

334
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,420
The last one.

335
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:51,420
It's so fun that I'm watching it again.

336
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:02,420
I fall asleep when I hear your voice.

337
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,420
Is it good?

338
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,420
It's good, right?

339
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,420
Radio, content like this?

340
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,420
I'll turn on the voice live often.

341
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,420
I don't count the amount.

342
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:31,710


343
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:37,246


344
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,420
I read a book.

345
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,420
When I read a book, I can't sleep.

346
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,420
Is it because I keep writing my eyes like this?

347
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,420
Or if I use my cell phone, I can't sleep.

348
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,420
Is it because my eyes are tired?

349
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,420
Can I sleep well even if I drink coffee?

350
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:40,420
I think I can sleep well even if I drink coffee.

351
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,420
I don't drink a lot of coffee.

352
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,420
I'm lying down.

353
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,420
Q. When are you going to sleep?

354
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,420
Are you sleepy?

355
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:05,420
If I'm sleepy, I go to bed.

356
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:10,047


357
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,420
I sleep well when I'm sleepy.

358
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:13,420
You know you have to sleep well to have a good night's sleep, right?

359
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,420
Q. How are you these days?

360
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,420
I don't want to.

361
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,420
I don't listen to you.

362
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,420
You're a troublemaker.

363
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,301


364
00:26:02,264 --> 00:26:04,607
Do you have any secrets?

365
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,420
Q. What is Chae Won's secret?

366
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:12,420
I don't know that combination well, actually.

367
00:26:14,443 --> 00:26:15,992
But I like fruit rings.

368
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,646
Choco shell, choco pop, and fruit ring.

369
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,420
It's delicious even if you eat it.

370
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:34,383
What's the point of this?

371
00:26:35,231 --> 00:26:36,315
Oh my god.

372
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,420
There's someone who's bigger than me.

373
00:26:46,723 --> 00:26:48,207
Chaewon, marry me.

374
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,420
Marry me.

375
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,420
Marry me.

376
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:02,420
Marry me.

377
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,284


378
00:27:28,267 --> 00:27:30,268


379
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,420
Chaewon, do you know that there are less than 90 days left this year?

380
00:28:14,997 --> 00:28:16,925


381
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,420
When did the year pass so fast?

382
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:03,420
Time flies so fast, doesn't it?

383
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:44,432
Then is they adult?

384
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,420
OMG

385
00:30:14,107 --> 00:30:16,107
Time flies.

386
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,420
What I felt was...

387
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:41,420
Among the Pianas, there are Pianas that I've seen for a long time, and there are Pianas that just came in.

388
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,420
They're all so precious and thankful.

389
00:30:46,873 --> 00:30:59,464
I haven't debuted in the entertainment industry for a long time.

390
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:59,464
It's been six years since I debuted.

391
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,420
That's about it.

392
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,420
That's why it's really...

393
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,420
My...

394
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,420
From the beginning...

395
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,420
I've seen...

396
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,420
I've seen...

397
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,420
People...

398
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,420
Keep, keep...

399
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,420
Keep, keep...

400
00:31:15,991 --> 00:31:40,357


401
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,420
Pianas who have been supporting me so far.

402
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,420
Really...

403
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,420
It was so amazing.

404
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,420
I'm so...

405
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,420
I'm so grateful.

406
00:31:40,424 --> 00:31:43,077


407
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:17,340
How was it?

408
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,420
That's fun.

409
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,420
I'm 업고양�再來.

410
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:32,372
Really, if we stay together for a long time with all the Pianas,

411
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:34,540
We're really amazing. I think we're going to fall in love.

412
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:39,980
If we don't have each other now, it's a big deal.

413
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,030
That's right.

414
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:19,180
Oh, yes. 50s.

415
00:33:19,048 --> 00:33:21,192
Oh, I...

416
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:21,360
I hope...

417
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:21,400
I hope... I hope...

418
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,480
I'll do my best until I reach my dream.

419
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,960
50 years old.

420
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,440
I work out a lot and take good care of my nutrients.

421
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,040
I'll do it until I'm in my 50s.

422
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,800
I'm in my 50s.

423
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:09,652
Oh, that's amazing, too.

424
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:14,900
There's a friend who's been liked me for a long time.

425
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,380
I was Mija, and she was Mija.

426
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,280
We grew up together.

427
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,200
But the words came back to the past.

428
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,920
How could she be so admissible?

429
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,040
I was able to live pretty well as a singer.

430
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:49,920
I wanted to do

431
00:35:02,548 --> 00:35:06,083


432
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,046
Should I go to bed now?

433
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,240
I'll go to bed now.

434
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,240
No.

435
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,240
Why?

436
00:35:46,202 --> 00:35:49,831
Because it's late.

437
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,240
It's 12 o'clock.

438
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,240
Oh my.

439
00:35:57,177 --> 00:35:59,100
Someone planned it.

440
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,240
Is 12 o'clock late?

441
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,240
It's the day after tomorrow.

442
00:36:07,826 --> 00:36:09,820


443
00:36:12,386 --> 00:36:18,365
Let's wake up and go to bed.

444
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,240
I'm sorry.

445
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,240
It's time to go to bed.

446
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,313


447
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:45,189
Now?

448
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,240
The time is early.

449
00:36:45,257 --> 00:36:51,524


450
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,240
It's the earliest time.

451
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:57,980
fasting

452
00:36:58,882 --> 00:37:00,544
This is the reason of sleeping.

453
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,220
Cheongyang red pepper, stolen

454
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,840
Come in the morning!

455
00:37:05,001 --> 00:37:06,228


456
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,640
I need to sleep first.

457
00:37:14,892 --> 00:37:16,683
Alrighty, let's begin.

458
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,020
Ah gimme a line..

459
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,020
I can't think of anything right now.

460
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,020
Assorted cream косpot...

461
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,020
Avocado?

462
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:23,020
I can only eat ssambap on my stomach right now.

463
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:26,020
London bagel looks delicious.

464
00:38:28,691 --> 00:38:30,692
Nemo Nemo Nemo Nemo

465
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,020
I don't like bagels.

466
00:38:37,001 --> 00:38:39,517
Don't eat bagels, then eat rice.

467
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,020
You don't really like bread.

468
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,920
I also recommended the ginger Hey I

469
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,020
came out this time. The ginger that came out was

470
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:53,810


471
00:39:05,703 --> 00:39:09,584
Wow, but the comments are faster than

472
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,880
I love you so much, not bagel.

473
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,480
What? I feel're so brushy!

474
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,213


475
00:39:33,363 --> 00:39:36,405
Thank you, V.

476
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,840
Thank you.

477
00:39:40,021 --> 00:39:43,841
Don't get mad at me.

478
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,160
I'm just kidding.

479
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
Why?

480
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,160
Because I'm going to bed really early tomorrow.

481
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,480
People say, that sleeping means problems.

482
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,320
Then, I'm going to be silly.

483
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,480
I'm sorry, Vihana.

484
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,040
You did good job.

485
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,560
Once again, let's be each other's storytelling several times.

486
00:40:44,739 --> 00:40:49,825


487
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,160
Let's try to be a fool

488
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,160
Now...

489
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,160
You know what?

490
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,160
If you sleep now,

491
00:40:55,568 --> 00:40:59,047
you'll be happy tomorrow

492
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,160
If you sleep now,

493
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,160
you'll be able to sleep well

494
00:40:59,888 --> 00:41:07,016
and your condition will be good

495
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,160
so you won't have any regrets tomorrow

496
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,160
Bye

497
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,160
See you next time

498
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,160
Bye

499
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,160
Bye bye

500
00:41:25,793 --> 00:41:26,921
