00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.480
- What's going on over there? - What is this?

00:00:05.615 --> 00:00:06.505
It's chaos

00:00:06.505 --> 00:00:07.697
hello

00:00:07.697 --> 00:00:10.150
- Today is the day of the final battle - Hello, today's guest.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.555
I brought my pouch well

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.685
I'm really looking forward to it

00:00:17.811 --> 00:00:18.825
The day of the decisive battle

00:00:18.825 --> 00:00:21.780
- It's the day of the final battle - Hello, I was ticking*

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.865
hello

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:24.749
- Yes, like this - It's the day of the final battle.

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:28.299
We finally completed our mission in one month.

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:30.234
It's been two months since I did it

00:00:32.284 --> 00:00:35.144
- Well, first of all... - Thank you for waiting for a long time.

00:00:35.144 --> 00:00:36.884
- I've been waiting for a long time. - I've been waiting for a long time.

00:00:36.884 --> 00:00:41.217
- Please spread the word about 'Idol Human Theater' widely, everyone. - That's right.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.690
We have to start now

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.099
- Are you ready? - Let's get started.

00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:47.043
- Start - Start

00:00:47.043 --> 00:00:50.432
- Eunchae - But I have some plans for later.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.180
Please take good care of me though

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.283
- Okay, okay, okay, okay - No, really.

00:00:56.283 --> 00:00:58.641
What's wrong? It's not what you do.

00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:00.558
- This is a total must- - Just a moment

00:01:01.023 --> 00:01:03.000
Wait a minute, there's one product

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.260
I'm going to practice after I finish, so

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.290
So facial recognition and stuff like that

00:01:09.415 --> 00:01:11.031
Facial recognition like this

00:01:11.248 --> 00:01:12.208
Should I just take one shot?

00:01:12.208 --> 00:01:13.775
Just close your eyes

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:18.423
- I have cleansing tissues too - I'll take a short form.

00:01:18.423 --> 00:01:20.752
Excuse me, shouldn't you do it too, Mr. Kura?

00:01:20.752 --> 00:01:22.553
I'm done right now

00:01:22.553 --> 00:01:24.868
- It's over right away? - It's over once you put it on.

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:32.200
- Eunchae is doing her makeup - She said she was waiting for Yoonjini's skills.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.995
It may not be your skill, you guys

00:01:33.995 --> 00:01:35.050
okay

00:01:37.165 --> 00:01:40.100
Okay, let's try lifting some of the bangs first.

00:01:40.153 --> 00:01:42.990
- No, why? - Why?

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.855
- Why are you here? - What should I do?

00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:46.847
okay

00:01:48.202 --> 00:01:49.901
- The eyes is here. - Okay.

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:52.775
- No, don't try to ruin me too much. - Okay.

00:01:52.775 --> 00:01:54.875
- I'm a celebrity, but - Okay, okay.

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:56.053
all right

00:01:56.053 --> 00:01:59.135
- We are idols before we are comedians - This cute

00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:02.209
- This is Kura's sister. - Is this Kura's?

00:02:02.284 --> 00:02:05.364
I get it, I get it, it's really noisy in the shop right now.

00:02:05.364 --> 00:02:07.793
First of all, it's very flashy

00:02:08.054 --> 00:02:11.314
I brought the most gorgeous palette I have.

00:02:11.314 --> 00:02:13.095
-Why did you bring the palette? - MAC

00:02:13.095 --> 00:02:15.048
- Isn't eyeliner enough? - As expected from a MAC girl

00:02:15.048 --> 00:02:17.985
You should have eyeliner and eye color

00:02:17.985 --> 00:02:21.140
But I have a short forehead here, between my eyebrows and my eyes.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.713
- I can do it really well - So it might be a little difficult.

00:02:24.713 --> 00:02:26.279
I have no eyes

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:27.445
Yes? What did you say?

00:02:27.445 --> 00:02:30.540
- But you really have to do it in moderation. - Okay, okay.

00:02:30.815 --> 00:02:34.169
Seriously, it's not a piece of paper

00:02:34.594 --> 00:02:36.020
Oh my gosh

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.745
- But two people have to do it - But

00:02:37.745 --> 00:02:39.515
- I have to do it quickly / - That's right - That's right

00:02:39.674 --> 00:02:41.847
- I want to cry - No, I'm crying

00:02:42.134 --> 00:02:44.951
- But if you're going to do it, you have to do it right, right? - You have to do it right.

00:02:44.951 --> 00:02:47.027
- That's true - Eunchae, it's the same.

00:02:47.027 --> 00:02:50.620
- Even if you just close it, you'll become like me - Even if you close it, it'll be like Eunchae

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.105
-Eun-chae even with her eyes closed-It's really not her business, everyone's in chaos right now

00:02:54.105 --> 00:02:56.452
Seriously, I'm in the same situation

00:02:56.452 --> 00:02:58.830
- What are you talking about, sis? - I told you I brought this.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.394
Sister, you are pretty now

00:03:00.394 --> 00:03:03.720
- I brought this because I have to do this. - You just need to put a pack on this face.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.660
Close your eyes, just close them.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.580
Yes, can you come a little closer?

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.625
- You may feel a little shaky due to the magnesium deficiency issue. - You may feel a little shaky.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.339
I might be a little nervous too. Okay, now open your eyes first.

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:17.771
Wait a minute, I won't laugh

00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:19.142
I'll hold back my laughter

00:03:19.437 --> 00:03:21.266
- I'm going - Mom, Mom

00:03:21.416 --> 00:03:22.930
- Mom - Mom

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.665
- A little bigger than your eyes - Don't rock the chair

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.240
why

00:03:30.934 --> 00:03:34.205
- I hope Eunchae doesn't see it until then - Close your eyes for a moment

00:03:34.205 --> 00:03:35.415
- Okay - Yeah

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.771
- Keep it on, or don't look in the mirror. - That's right. / - Keep it on.

00:03:39.771 --> 00:03:41.867
- No, please make it pretty, unnie. - Just look down.

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.646
A bit like a cat

00:03:43.646 --> 00:03:46.636
- You're a total cat right now - But please do it with pretty eyes

00:03:46.636 --> 00:03:50.715
Yeah, you have such pretty eyes, they're so long and big.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.280
Don't worry

00:03:53.595 --> 00:03:55.260
I'm good at drawing.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.540
Shout Out to KBS KPOP

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.675
- Is it KPOP KBS? KBS KPOP - Okay

00:04:00.725 --> 00:04:02.321
'Idol Human Theater'

00:04:02.635 --> 00:04:05.470
First, I'll just draw the eye base.

00:04:05.695 --> 00:04:08.375
Your eyes are a bit big

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.015
- That's a bit big. - It's really big. Really big.

00:04:12.015 --> 00:04:15.428
- But the line is pretty - But it looks like a cat, a cat

00:04:15.428 --> 00:04:17.246
Okay, what will happen when I open my eyes?

00:04:17.246 --> 00:04:18.950
Doesn't it look like a perfect line?

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.035
But don't you have to draw the eyebrows like this?

00:04:21.035 --> 00:04:24.132
- So, let's just get the basics down first. - Be quiet.

00:04:24.132 --> 00:04:26.906
- How do I draw the eyeballs? I have to draw the eyeballs too. - Please be quiet.

00:04:29.655 --> 00:04:33.125
Do you guys have a group like this? Is it really true?

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.620
- It's cute. - Have you seen it?

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.865
Now you've seen it, because we're doing it.

00:04:38.865 --> 00:04:41.779
I think it will be a live that will go down in history.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.340
And this is what I do and dance

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.415
How are you filming now?

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.570
You are really so pretty right now

00:04:49.993 --> 00:04:51.861
But honestly, doesn't this symmetry match up so well?

00:04:51.861 --> 00:04:54.022
But the symmetry is really good

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.778
- What should I do? - Seriously, if I do this much, I'll have makeup like this.

00:04:57.778 --> 00:04:59.775
Now all I have to do is draw the pupils

00:04:59.775 --> 00:05:01.654
There really is makeup like this

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.108
- Wow, so pretty - It's like a pictorial right now

00:05:04.108 --> 00:05:07.446
First of all, first of all, then I will make the pupils for you.

00:05:07.446 --> 00:05:09.009
- Pupil - No cotton swabs here?

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:11.305
- Cotton swab - I think I'm going to cry

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.495
- Are you about to cry? Are you so touched? - I have wet tissues.

00:05:14.838 --> 00:05:16.190
now...

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.178
- No cotton swabs. - You can't open your eyes, right? Not yet. / - No, you can't.

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.799
Yes, yes, there are cotton swabs

00:05:21.799 --> 00:05:22.989
When will it be?

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:25.545
It's a bit like this...

00:05:25.637 --> 00:05:27.388
- It's been a while - Then it's okay.

00:05:27.388 --> 00:05:30.020
- It's new, but please use only this side. The other side... - It's new, it's new.

00:05:30.578 --> 00:05:32.184
- Here - Yes, yes, use that.

00:05:32.184 --> 00:05:33.301
Are you crying?

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:35.525
- I'm so touched - Yes, I'll write it there.

00:05:35.525 --> 00:05:37.040
There are too many, okay guys

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.558
- Whether the eye color is pink, purple or glitter - The eye color is

00:05:42.438 --> 00:05:45.460
- It's white / - This needs to be voted on / - This needs to be voted on / - Vote

00:05:45.585 --> 00:05:47.907
Or just something safe like brown?

00:05:47.907 --> 00:05:49.234
But this is a bit boring

00:05:49.234 --> 00:05:52.259
- I guess / - Pupils? - The pupils are brown.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.260
The pupils

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.960
What lenses do you want to wear today?

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.205
What are your options?

00:05:59.205 --> 00:06:02.665
- The choice is now - I wore brown lenses today.

00:06:02.665 --> 00:06:04.065
"Is Chaewon doing Zhao too?"

00:06:04.065 --> 00:06:05.557
- What are you talking about? - Look this way.

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:07.342
- Then you can't see it. - We're not punished.

00:06:07.342 --> 00:06:08.947
- We did - Lens color

00:06:08.947 --> 00:06:10.396
- But do you want to do a little bit? - This? / - Or

00:06:10.396 --> 00:06:12.346
- No, I don't want to. - This one? Or this one?

00:06:12.367 --> 00:06:13.995
Let's do this Let's do this

00:06:13.995 --> 00:06:15.623
- You want to do it, Zha? - I like it too.

00:06:15.873 --> 00:06:17.460
- I'm curious - I'll do it next time.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.754
Zha is curious

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.655
Do you want to do it too?

00:06:20.655 --> 00:06:22.719
- Zha, do you want to do it? - Zha wants to do this too...

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:25.752
- That's why / - Zha is always like this - I want to receive it together

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:29.973
From the beginning, she kept saying, "My eyes are really good, so I do things like this."

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.412
- Appeal Appeal - You should have switched with me back then, sis

00:06:34.412 --> 00:06:35.321
I changed it

00:06:35.696 --> 00:06:37.997
Wow you guys are really sparkly

00:06:38.906 --> 00:06:40.975
- MAC, I guess - MAC, I guess

00:06:40.975 --> 00:06:42.477
Fullme like this

00:06:43.735 --> 00:06:45.760
Oh, whose car is that

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.630
Don't keep putting your hand in

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:50.279
The problem is that there is a hole.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.720
Draw the pupils

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.340
Can you see it?

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.700
- Boldly - But you're drawing the border, right?

00:07:00.133 --> 00:07:01.176
I have to draw it

00:07:01.176 --> 00:07:03.203
- It looks like a lens, but really - Oh, it looks like a lens

00:07:08.715 --> 00:07:11.280
I'll close my eyes and relax.

00:07:12.245 --> 00:07:13.815
I should do it like this

00:07:15.785 --> 00:07:18.455
- It's real, it's scary - It's really scary

00:07:21.802 --> 00:07:23.662
- I'm scared - Just a moment

00:07:23.662 --> 00:07:25.760
- It really looks like eyes, really. - Why? Does it look real?

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.115
Just once, just once, just once

00:07:27.115 --> 00:07:28.893
- Really keep looking at me - Stay still

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.508
- It looks like real eyes / - It looks real - Is it scary?

00:07:31.508 --> 00:07:33.850
- But the details are still - a little bit

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.161
I'm a little scared

00:07:35.355 --> 00:07:36.980
I'm really a bit scared

00:07:37.375 --> 00:07:39.330
- I have to see the comments - This is really awesome

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.814
Please read the comments

00:07:40.814 --> 00:07:42.094
Please read the comments

00:07:44.975 --> 00:07:46.550
- "Wow" - "Wow"

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.148
But really, it'll be over in 5 minutes

00:07:48.148 --> 00:07:50.108
"Eunchae, don't cry when you see me"

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:52.600
- No - "I'm scared"

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.010
- Scary - Scary

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.150

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:08.740
- Draw it, draw it - I need to draw a border

00:08:08.765 --> 00:08:11.805
- Anyway, don't laugh, don't laugh - Not yet, it's not finished yet, sis

00:08:11.805 --> 00:08:14.500
- Don't make me laugh. My hands are shaking. - Why are you here? Your face is shaking.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.600
You're not crying, are you?

00:08:20.336 --> 00:08:22.382
Yunjin Ah, you're doing well

00:08:22.382 --> 00:08:24.445
Good job, you practiced, right?

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.255
Sister, this was your dream, this was your dream

00:08:28.255 --> 00:08:29.815
Since I was young

00:08:29.815 --> 00:08:33.340
- I need to put some dots here too - You're really good

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.735
My sister said this was her dream since she was little

00:08:35.735 --> 00:08:37.450
Really good

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:38.900
Please draw a little dot

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.660
Could you please take a picture of this hand that is tightly holding my forehead?

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.740
I guess

00:08:48.035 --> 00:08:50.710
- Wow, that's awesome, but you're good at it. - It's scary.

00:08:50.909 --> 00:08:52.763
Hey, good job

00:08:52.763 --> 00:08:56.674
- No, it looks more real when you look at it on the screen like this. - It looks real.

00:08:56.674 --> 00:08:58.368
- Look at the screen - It looks real

00:08:58.368 --> 00:09:00.275
You yourself are a bit like a painting

00:09:03.598 --> 00:09:05.312
scared

00:09:05.312 --> 00:09:08.925
- It's time to be pretty, it's time to be pretty. - I'm scared, Eunchae.

00:09:10.311 --> 00:09:12.135
- I haven't put on any eye makeup yet. - Yeah, I haven't done it yet.

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.769
- Now I have eyes - Now I have eyes

00:09:14.769 --> 00:09:18.958
Now I will draw the double eyelids and eyelashes.

00:09:19.741 --> 00:09:22.580
- Eunchae, please smile / - Today is Legend Live - It's Legend?

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.150
But can I see this?

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:30.460
- Do you have to close your eyes to see it? - Yeah, I can't see it.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.780
- I'll take a picture for you - You'll never see yourself again

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.757
Eunchae, our eyes are meeting right now

00:09:36.442 --> 00:09:38.365
- That's fun too - Here it is.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.770
I have to film myself doing that this is tick*

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:45.115
You know what that is, not making eye contact?

00:09:45.345 --> 00:09:48.065
You have to play this game while drinking water and not making eye contact

00:09:48.065 --> 00:09:51.297
- Bring water. Water, water standby. - Really?

00:09:51.297 --> 00:09:52.211
Should I bring it?

00:09:52.211 --> 00:09:53.310
Good job

00:09:53.575 --> 00:09:54.799
It's so so good

00:09:54.799 --> 00:09:55.907
Makeup

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.160
scared

00:10:00.239 --> 00:10:03.336
- No, it's really scary when you look at it from here. - But why are you so good at it?

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.820
I feel like my eyes are going to twitch

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:08.905
- Once - I'm almost done.

00:10:08.905 --> 00:10:10.515
Do you want to open your eyes?

00:10:10.515 --> 00:10:13.210
- But why does this reach my eyebrows? - When I open my eyes, this

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.572
- I'm afraid it'll spread. - Oh, I'm afraid it'll spread.

00:10:15.572 --> 00:10:17.933
I could feel the texture all the way to my eyebrows

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.320
It looks more realistic from a distance

00:10:21.833 --> 00:10:24.157
- Wait a minute, wait a minute, not yet, not yet - Smile, smile

00:10:24.157 --> 00:10:25.490
The pupil is still a little dilated

00:10:25.858 --> 00:10:27.440
- Should it be darker? - Should it be darker?

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.513
I can't see it well on camera

00:10:28.513 --> 00:10:29.807
Where is the camera?

00:10:31.085 --> 00:10:33.125
- Wow, I love it so much - It's awesome.

00:10:34.541 --> 00:10:35.662
Oh my god

00:10:36.913 --> 00:10:38.957
This is really awesome

00:10:40.895 --> 00:10:43.240
I wish I could capture it beautifully

00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:44.497
- The pretty part. - Pretty.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.740
They're all pretty, what should I do?

00:10:48.685 --> 00:10:50.965
No, Eunchae's face itself looks a bit like a painting right now

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.685
Because the eyes are drawn like that

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:54.540
You really look like a doll.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.637
The under eyelashes are awesome though

00:10:56.637 --> 00:10:58.833
- That's why - No one grows up this well.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.320
Do you have more lower lashes?

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.795
Under eyelashes are actually my eyebrows

00:11:05.795 --> 00:11:07.580
Real, real eyelashes

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.320
- Is that what it looks like now? - Yeah.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:16.040
You did so well

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.480
- No, really - Well done

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.215
No really

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.880
- Really - Really

00:11:23.178 --> 00:11:24.604
A bit like that

00:11:25.211 --> 00:11:26.974
It's like a real emoticon

00:11:27.217 --> 00:11:28.475
Laugh laugh laugh

00:11:28.475 --> 00:11:30.103
Aren't you opening your eyes?

00:11:30.332 --> 00:11:31.795
But this is so good

00:11:32.064 --> 00:11:33.120
Crazy

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.730
- I shouldn't sleep, but when I'm too sleepy - Wait a minute, I'm just going to pack

00:11:36.055 --> 00:11:38.288
Just pack

00:11:38.288 --> 00:11:39.789
It's so good okay

00:11:39.989 --> 00:11:40.979
Is it done?

00:11:40.979 --> 00:11:43.467
Can I open my eyes slightly and comb my bangs?

00:11:44.023 --> 00:11:45.558
But it's so good

00:11:46.255 --> 00:11:47.995
But aren't the spaces between your eyebrows too wide?

00:11:47.995 --> 00:11:50.595
Eunchae, but it's a little bit gathered inside the eyeball.

00:11:50.595 --> 00:11:52.192
Are your eyes closed?

00:11:52.192 --> 00:11:54.007
- Really? - No, no

00:11:54.007 --> 00:11:55.247
I feel like I'm looking inside something

00:11:55.247 --> 00:11:58.058
Are you okay? Does my face look okay right now?

00:11:58.058 --> 00:11:59.620
It's totally okay, Eunchae

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.772
I really think it's just popping up

00:12:01.772 --> 00:12:03.452
I think it's really hot

00:12:03.452 --> 00:12:05.944
- I think my eyes are open - You did really well, I think I'm crazy

00:12:06.489 --> 00:12:08.388
Something new like this

00:12:08.388 --> 00:12:09.921
I feel like my eyes are really open

00:12:09.921 --> 00:12:11.817
How did you take pictures of the jacket like this?

00:12:12.281 --> 00:12:14.000
- But really - possible possible

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.320
Why did you do this so well?

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:18.145
Did you practice?

00:12:18.576 --> 00:12:20.290
- I've been doing a lot of image training at home now. - Peace, peace.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:21.871
Peace Peace

00:12:21.871 --> 00:12:24.035
You're cute, our Eunchae

00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:25.276
What kind of lens is it?

00:12:25.276 --> 00:12:26.897
- But how do you wink? - What kind of lenses are those?

00:12:26.897 --> 00:12:28.243
Just take a picture

00:12:31.805 --> 00:12:34.000
Okay okay look show it to Eunchae

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.588
- Eunchae-ya - Yes? Are you opening your eyes?

00:12:35.588 --> 00:12:37.583
When you open your eyes, you can't see it?

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.186
It's so real

00:12:42.186 --> 00:12:43.781
It's so real

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.185
Close your eyes for a moment.

00:12:48.185 --> 00:12:49.191
Come on

00:12:49.689 --> 00:12:51.634
- Wow but really - Wow that's amazing

00:12:52.106 --> 00:12:53.637
It's so real

00:12:53.637 --> 00:12:55.003
It's so real

00:12:55.003 --> 00:12:56.298
oh my god

00:12:56.602 --> 00:12:57.823
oh my god

00:12:59.795 --> 00:13:03.490
Okay, I think Eunchae is perfect to this extent.

00:13:05.855 --> 00:13:08.540
- Wow, wait a minute, wait a minute, this is amazing - It's amazing, even when I open my eyes

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.345
- I think it's really, really good. - Where did you go? My...

00:13:10.831 --> 00:13:13.076
- Where is Oppa? - Oppa is here, here

00:13:13.575 --> 00:13:15.540
Here here here

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.609
- Now let's change seats. Next - Next

00:13:17.609 --> 00:13:19.042
- Should I wait like this? - I

00:13:19.042 --> 00:13:20.221
- Then - wait

00:13:20.221 --> 00:13:21.918
You can close your eyes

00:13:21.918 --> 00:13:24.161
Would you please close your eyes and wait here next to me?

00:13:24.509 --> 00:13:25.368
Sit down

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.339
Or should I take a picture of that? That

00:13:30.339 --> 00:13:32.631
- I need to take a selfie - while waiting

00:13:36.065 --> 00:13:38.150
I'll finish it really quickly

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.894
- Yes, just paste it. - That's right.

00:13:39.894 --> 00:13:41.108
Really pack

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.260
Where is this?

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.600
- It's Primera - Primera

00:13:44.955 --> 00:13:46.276
Primera

00:13:46.714 --> 00:13:48.884
Looks like very good quality

00:13:49.215 --> 00:13:50.725
- Really big - I like this

00:13:52.813 --> 00:13:54.429
- Oppachoo - Oppachoo

00:13:54.429 --> 00:13:55.910
Oppaju

00:13:58.137 --> 00:13:59.511
Next is Sakura

00:13:59.511 --> 00:14:01.811
Wait a minute, do I have to show you this?

00:14:01.811 --> 00:14:03.159
Should I take a look first?

00:14:04.041 --> 00:14:05.660
- Isn't it? - Appearance check?

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.170
- Check your appearance - I'll be checking your appearance.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:09.529
Appearance check

00:14:14.046 --> 00:14:15.881
Your face looks like a seal

00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:17.020
fur seal

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.460
seal

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.536
- It's pretty. - It's pretty.

00:14:20.816 --> 00:14:21.950
It's pretty

00:14:22.175 --> 00:14:23.765
What kind of punishment is this?

00:14:23.765 --> 00:14:24.901
It's pretty

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.300
It's a shame I should have done it on my way to work

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.434
- We've been recording too much - too much, that's a bit...

00:14:32.434 --> 00:14:35.027
- Keep doing Sanok in the morning - Yeah, yeah

00:14:35.027 --> 00:14:36.910
- The timing was a bit vague, yes - and there was an event going on.

00:14:38.688 --> 00:14:40.279
No, wait a minute

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.040
This

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.125
- Real vitamins, full of vitamins - That's right, that's right / - Take it out?

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.240
Because this is separate

00:14:57.685 --> 00:14:59.195
Wow this smells so good

00:14:59.195 --> 00:15:01.113
- Pretty, pretty - Looks good

00:15:01.113 --> 00:15:03.015
Looks really good

00:15:03.015 --> 00:15:04.795
- It's like a mask. - Really? / - Yeah.

00:15:04.795 --> 00:15:06.410
Take them one by one

00:15:07.685 --> 00:15:09.020
How many are inside?

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.185
- There are many, there are many - It's fast.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:11.861
- Okay - The end

00:15:12.238 --> 00:15:13.163
it's okay?

00:15:13.163 --> 00:15:15.222
- My sister and I should do that. - It's still pretty.

00:15:15.222 --> 00:15:17.165
Yeah, two, two

00:15:17.196 --> 00:15:19.353
Let's take a picture now. Let's take a picture now. Should I bring water?

00:15:19.353 --> 00:15:21.344
It's fun when there's water, water, water

00:15:21.646 --> 00:15:24.653
- Can you actually squirt water? - Actually

00:15:24.653 --> 00:15:25.794
Should I bring you some water?

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.440
- Is this it? - Two would be enough?

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.635
- Yes - Yeah

00:15:34.635 --> 00:15:35.659
There was no sound or anything?

00:15:35.659 --> 00:15:37.470
- I don't know - I think it was just taken

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.044
- Just take a picture / - Later - Okay, okay

00:15:46.138 --> 00:15:48.103
I really like this, this

00:15:48.628 --> 00:15:50.165
- suddenly - promotion / - promotion

00:15:50.813 --> 00:15:53.013
Contains vitatinol

00:15:54.573 --> 00:15:55.743
Are you okay, Eunchae?

00:15:59.183 --> 00:16:00.708
Need to lower it a bit more

00:16:01.383 --> 00:16:03.648
- Two of you have capture time - Two of you capture, okay

00:16:04.343 --> 00:16:05.558
Time for just the two of us

00:16:06.045 --> 00:16:07.398
Time for just the two of us

00:16:10.433 --> 00:16:13.193
You're a makeup artist, come here.

00:16:18.908 --> 00:16:20.523
Thank you thank you thank you

00:16:20.874 --> 00:16:21.582
thank you

00:16:21.753 --> 00:16:23.538
Please take lots of pretty pictures

00:16:23.822 --> 00:16:25.046
My work

00:16:25.663 --> 00:16:27.403
- Thank you. - Is the water coming?

00:16:27.962 --> 00:16:30.023
- Coming - Like this

00:16:30.023 --> 00:16:32.343
- Settings? - I need to see the reaction.

00:16:36.693 --> 00:16:39.291
But how do you do it? Do it like this

00:16:39.622 --> 00:16:41.891
I have to open my eyes like this every once in a while

00:16:41.891 --> 00:16:44.871
- You can't open your eyes at the same time - But / - You can't make eye contact, so...

00:16:45.483 --> 00:16:46.643
Let's practice

00:16:46.643 --> 00:16:47.953
- Eyes - one, two, three

00:16:51.788 --> 00:16:53.605
- This won't do. - Then it won't do.

00:16:53.605 --> 00:16:55.215
- This is not right. - But what is this?

00:16:55.215 --> 00:16:57.958
Sister Kura, I can't laugh

00:16:58.274 --> 00:16:59.583
If you laugh, it will fall off

00:17:00.523 --> 00:17:02.663
Don't laugh, if you laugh...

00:17:02.663 --> 00:17:04.653
You look so funny when you laugh

00:17:06.041 --> 00:17:07.998
All I can see is teeth

00:17:07.998 --> 00:17:09.748
When you smile, only your teeth are visible

00:17:10.828 --> 00:17:13.043
- This is how you do it - That'll do it / - Okay, okay

00:17:14.328 --> 00:17:15.343
It's so funny

00:17:16.293 --> 00:17:18.303
We're really having fun...

00:17:20.318 --> 00:17:23.400
But when I open my eyes, there really isn't anything

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.892
- Then I'll just do this - Then

00:17:27.583 --> 00:17:31.383
I can never hold it for a long time

00:17:35.943 --> 00:17:37.533
He said she digested everything by laughing

00:17:37.826 --> 00:17:40.169
- That's fortunate. - That's fortunate.

00:17:40.169 --> 00:17:40.988
- Thank goodness - "Yujam Group"

00:17:40.988 --> 00:17:44.778
Please spread the word that this is a fun group, everyone.

00:17:44.778 --> 00:17:46.601
- You're here / - Okay - You're here Water

00:17:46.601 --> 00:17:47.599
You have arrived

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.209
Now the water...

00:17:56.731 --> 00:17:57.909
thank you

00:17:59.723 --> 00:18:01.603
Wait a minute, are you doing this right?

00:18:01.965 --> 00:18:04.613
- What if I really spit it out? - What if I really spit it out?

00:18:05.103 --> 00:18:07.363
- We should just go like that. - Just go like that.

00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:09.978
I guess we should just go with that

00:18:10.176 --> 00:18:11.086
Yeah what

00:18:12.823 --> 00:18:15.133
Don't you have that? The one you use when dyeing your hair?

00:18:15.448 --> 00:18:17.032
- I think so? - I think so?

00:18:17.032 --> 00:18:19.005
- Are you nervous? / - Yes. - Yes.

00:18:21.803 --> 00:18:22.738
I'll borrow it

00:18:23.518 --> 00:18:24.683
Are there only big ones?

00:18:24.683 --> 00:18:26.223
I think I'll be here for a while

00:18:26.664 --> 00:18:28.771
- Are you doing it now? - Do it.

00:18:28.771 --> 00:18:31.338
Wait a minute, but what the heck

00:18:34.843 --> 00:18:36.268
It's like a ghost

00:18:36.839 --> 00:18:37.868
what...

00:18:41.213 --> 00:18:42.193
I'm going crazy

00:18:42.193 --> 00:18:43.904
There was one more, one more

00:18:43.904 --> 00:18:45.082
There is one

00:18:45.317 --> 00:18:46.981
It's a bit small though

00:18:47.401 --> 00:18:50.022
What is this situation?

00:18:50.367 --> 00:18:51.881
Where did the water go?

00:18:58.741 --> 00:18:59.962
Why is this so funny

00:19:01.164 --> 00:19:03.940
- What? - But shouldn't two people sit together? / - That's right.

00:19:04.164 --> 00:19:05.971
- Sit here / - Sit here - Are you coming out?

00:19:05.971 --> 00:19:08.328
- No, let's do this - Let's do the small one.

00:19:17.903 --> 00:19:19.604
- Sit down - One by one

00:19:19.604 --> 00:19:21.431
Isn't it too close? Just a moment.

00:19:23.289 --> 00:19:24.963
Please drink water

00:19:24.963 --> 00:19:27.272
- Please hold it. - Please be the moderator in the middle.

00:19:27.272 --> 00:19:28.763
Just record this on video

00:19:28.763 --> 00:19:30.658
- I'll have to edit it later - Okay, okay

00:19:31.154 --> 00:19:31.938

00:19:31.938 --> 00:19:34.960
- Please drink some water. - Chaewon, please host. / - This is already funny. What should I do?

00:19:36.548 --> 00:19:38.623
- Chaewon, please proceed. - Why, why, why? / - A lot? A lot?

00:19:39.081 --> 00:19:41.901
- Just something moderate? - Yes, something moderate enough to hold.

00:19:42.633 --> 00:19:46.018
- I'll leave this to Chaewon now. - Are you done?

00:19:46.491 --> 00:19:48.574
- Hold on - Now close your eyes.

00:19:49.943 --> 00:19:51.383
Please close your eyes

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:55.108
To me?

00:19:55.153 --> 00:19:55.919
okay

00:19:55.919 --> 00:19:57.862
- Close your eyes. - Okay, okay, okay.

00:19:58.783 --> 00:20:00.277
- No, already - Really?

00:20:00.277 --> 00:20:02.668
- I don't think Eunchae will work? - Eunchae, Eunchae

00:20:02.668 --> 00:20:05.739
- Eunchae-ya - Let's start, one, two, three.

00:20:07.071 --> 00:20:09.147
I don't think Eunchae will work

00:20:09.739 --> 00:20:10.842
Eunchae

00:20:11.483 --> 00:20:13.103
You have to play the game

00:20:21.816 --> 00:20:24.320
- But you have to show these eyes here - Kura unnie is totally...

00:20:26.763 --> 00:20:28.222
Okay okay okay

00:20:28.222 --> 00:20:30.137
Swallow, swallow, swallow the water

00:20:30.137 --> 00:20:32.833
- I feel like I'm going to die. - You two need to stick together so I can see your eyes.

00:20:32.833 --> 00:20:34.311
Making eye contact

00:20:34.643 --> 00:20:35.888
A little further forward?

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:38.182
Stick forward and stick to each other

00:20:38.182 --> 00:20:41.313
- This is so funny, what should I do? I really - This is fun when we stick together.

00:20:41.313 --> 00:20:42.477
So funny

00:20:43.368 --> 00:20:46.071
- I'm really laughing so hard, what should I do? - What should I do?

00:20:46.071 --> 00:20:48.203
- Let's stick to each other like this. - Stick, stick together.

00:20:48.388 --> 00:20:50.810
- Stick closer, stick closer - Can I do it once without water?

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.861
- Okay, okay, I got it - Practice without water.

00:20:53.963 --> 00:20:56.563
- Wait, don't laugh. - No, I'm shaking like this because I'm laughing.

00:20:56.838 --> 00:20:58.287
I will do it

00:20:59.963 --> 00:21:00.903
start

00:21:04.703 --> 00:21:07.078
Let's decide who to start with

00:21:07.078 --> 00:21:08.923
Okay let's start with Eunchae

00:21:08.923 --> 00:21:10.087
- I'm doing it - Okay

00:21:10.087 --> 00:21:11.250
- Really? - Really?

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.883
Seriously, what should I do?

00:21:12.883 --> 00:21:14.473
- Eunchae, you can do this. - Do this...

00:21:14.473 --> 00:21:15.480
near?

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:17.985
- What should I do? - Like this

00:21:26.283 --> 00:21:29.013
A video that will go down in history

00:21:34.363 --> 00:21:36.808
- No, why don't you just drink water? - Eunchae-ya / - Why not already?

00:21:36.808 --> 00:21:39.218
I got a disease where I just drink water and laugh

00:21:40.438 --> 00:21:43.603
I think I really need to give Eunchae a cup

00:21:45.878 --> 00:21:47.323
From Eunchae, from Eunchae

00:21:48.039 --> 00:21:49.251
start

00:21:58.063 --> 00:22:01.123
Hey, Eunchae, I don't know if your eyes are open or not.

00:22:07.443 --> 00:22:09.648
- There's chaos - I don't know if you've seen it or not

00:22:09.648 --> 00:22:11.193
- Hey Eunchae - Eunchae

00:22:12.188 --> 00:22:15.328
- The match is not possible, the match is not possible - The game is not progressing right now.

00:22:15.328 --> 00:22:16.189
teacher

00:22:17.172 --> 00:22:18.082
really

00:22:18.757 --> 00:22:20.042
Are you okay?

00:22:23.503 --> 00:22:25.793
This is so funny, what should I do? Seriously

00:22:29.343 --> 00:22:32.523
- Are you really open your eyes or not? - Just look at me once, Yunjin.

00:22:33.143 --> 00:22:35.562
- Mine? / - Did you take a picture? - Just to see if the amount came out or not

00:22:35.562 --> 00:22:38.558
- Is the amount out? - Discuss the amount / - The amount

00:22:39.583 --> 00:22:42.588
But no one could spit it out

00:22:42.588 --> 00:22:44.466
So, without spitting anything out

00:22:45.054 --> 00:22:46.781
- Just one more time - No, just one more time

00:22:46.781 --> 00:22:47.684
- Don't laugh - Seriously

00:22:49.584 --> 00:22:51.483
- One more time - It's okay to spit it out

00:22:56.543 --> 00:22:57.593
calm down

00:23:00.478 --> 00:23:03.688
- Can you calm down with this? - Yes, I'll leave work like this.

00:23:11.783 --> 00:23:12.988
Come closer

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:15.901
I feel like it's going to go into my nose

00:23:18.363 --> 00:23:19.743
start

00:23:28.273 --> 00:23:29.473
Are you still doing it?

00:23:31.588 --> 00:23:33.283
what are you doing

00:23:34.783 --> 00:23:36.523
If this continues, I'll hear a noise

00:23:37.753 --> 00:23:41.111
- But it really holds water well. - Yes, up to here.

00:23:41.363 --> 00:23:43.450
I think I would have just spit it out

00:23:44.275 --> 00:23:45.438
Want to try?

00:23:45.438 --> 00:23:46.620
Want to try it? Together?

00:23:46.943 --> 00:23:48.983
Yoonjin and Eunchae, try it

00:23:48.983 --> 00:23:53.183
- I have so much mental strength - Do it, do it, do it quickly / - My sister

00:23:53.183 --> 00:23:55.687
- Sister, so you hold back your laughter well - It doesn't mean anything, hold back well, hold back well

00:23:55.687 --> 00:23:58.495
- That's right / - Come here - I'm so used to it now.

00:23:58.495 --> 00:24:00.162

00:24:00.162 --> 00:24:01.362
Makeup artist

00:24:02.165 --> 00:24:03.458
On top of makeup...

00:24:03.774 --> 00:24:06.183
Look at your skin, your skin is suddenly

00:24:10.455 --> 00:24:12.096
As a bonus

00:24:13.588 --> 00:24:15.988
I'm scared, though?

00:24:16.988 --> 00:24:19.308
What if I squirt in your real face?

00:24:20.913 --> 00:24:22.203
I'm really sorry

00:24:22.548 --> 00:24:23.862
Squirt squirt

Hey, squirt, squirt, squirt

Poem... Close your eyes

00:24:55.479 --> 00:24:57.296

Did you spit it out?

00:25:08.668 --> 00:25:10.223
You didn't spit it out?

00:25:15.959 --> 00:25:17.373
One more time, one mall time

00:25:49.046 --> 00:25:50.631
The live isn't over yet

00:25:50.857 --> 00:25:52.490
- That's right, I didn't say 'CRAZY'. - Really?

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:54.835
- 'CRAZY', that's right, that's right - It has to be 'CRAZY'

00:25:56.763 --> 00:25:58.678
- Video, video end - Video end

00:26:00.147 --> 00:26:03.538

It was good

00:26:13.328 --> 00:26:14.861
- Clean up - Wipe off some water

Let me wipe the water off.

00:26:24.488 --> 00:26:26.813
- Seriously - so funny

00:26:31.668 --> 00:26:33.893
There isn't much water though

00:26:33.893 --> 00:26:38.043
- I couldn't spit out much water. - I was scared so I drank only a little.

00:26:39.928 --> 00:26:41.223
I think so

00:26:50.074 --> 00:26:51.019
okay

It looks like something brown, but I'm not sure

00:27:54.623 --> 00:27:56.443
The youngest is showing off his talents

00:27:59.203 --> 00:28:00.833
Is your beard graying?

00:28:52.798 --> 00:28:53.798
I'm doing well

00:28:58.343 --> 00:28:59.563
Everyone is doing well

00:29:00.186 --> 00:29:01.172

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:14.193
Good job
