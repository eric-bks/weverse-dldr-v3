00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:18,831
Hi

2
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,240
Hi

3
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,580
Hi

4
00:00:31,393 --> 00:00:35,835
Hello, hello. Hi. What
is it?

5
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:41,160
Is it me? Hi, hi.

6
00:00:47,437 --> 00:00:51,038
The title of the song is
called Self-Strike. I'm just

7
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,952
going to play before I go
to bed because I'm bored.

8
00:00:56,852 --> 00:01:02,641
If you have any questions for me,
please ask me. I'll answer them all.

9
00:01:03,643 --> 00:01:11,643
I'm nervous. I was just wondering
if you had any questions for me.

10
00:01:14,644 --> 00:01:21,643
It's not Eunchae's voice.
Whose voice is it then? It's mine.

11
00:01:21,644 --> 00:01:25,643
What are you doing now? I washed up.

12
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,644
I finished everything and lay down.

13
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:36,644
How tall are you now? 170 cm? But I
don't think I'm tall anymore. I don't know.

14
00:01:36,645 --> 00:01:40,168
Eunchae, are you sleeping
late today? I'm not sleeping late.

15
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:45,546
Fireworks? I didn't see it.

16
00:01:49,796 --> 00:01:51,645
I saw it in the video.

17
00:01:52,304 --> 00:01:53,645
TMI?

18
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:59,298
I feel good because I
scrubbed my body today.

19
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,646
What are you guys doing?

20
00:02:09,647 --> 00:02:13,756
Do you see all the piano
faces on the concert stage?

21
00:02:13,781 --> 00:02:16,981
I can't see all the pianos. But,

22
00:02:17,952 --> 00:02:22,306
I think I
can see almost all the pianos on the floor.

23
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:26,647
Please sing me a crazy song.

24
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:28,990
The answer makes me super crazy.

25
00:02:29,365 --> 00:02:30,648
Where are you?

26
00:02:31,123 --> 00:02:32,648
I'm at home.

27
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,648
How was Daegu? The
makchang was really good.

28
00:02:36,649 --> 00:02:38,940
Eunchae, did you catch a cold?

29
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:41,648
I didn't catch a cold.

30
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,640
Isn't it because it's been a
long time since I did a voice live?

31
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,048
Do you want me to give you a
spoiler? What kind of spoiler?

32
00:02:50,775 --> 00:02:52,515
I didn't catch a cold.

33
00:02:57,404 --> 00:03:02,590
This is where they are loverly.

34
00:03:03,523 --> 00:03:07,681


35
00:03:08,298 --> 00:03:10,157


36
00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:19,651
Happy New Year

37
00:03:19,652 --> 00:03:20,651
I'm listening.

38
00:03:20,652 --> 00:03:21,651
Sorry.

39
00:03:21,652 --> 00:03:23,652
It's a trap.

40
00:03:27,313 --> 00:03:28,312
Dialect?

41
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,633
I don't like it.

42
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,700
I don't like it.

43
00:03:32,693 --> 00:03:34,693
I don't like it. I don't like it.

44
00:03:39,893 --> 00:03:41,893
Japanese?

45
00:03:41,894 --> 00:03:43,894
Today, too.

46
00:03:45,094 --> 00:03:47,093
It's raining.

47
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,093
Today, too.

48
00:03:49,094 --> 00:03:51,093
Today, too.

49
00:03:51,094 --> 00:03:53,093
Today, too.

50
00:03:53,094 --> 00:03:55,093
Today, too.

51
00:03:55,094 --> 00:03:57,094
Fan signing.

52
00:03:57,095 --> 00:03:59,094
Fan signing.

53
00:03:59,095 --> 00:04:01,094
Thank you for coming.

54
00:04:01,095 --> 00:04:03,094
Thank you for coming.

55
00:04:03,095 --> 00:04:05,094
Thank you for coming.

56
00:04:05,095 --> 00:04:07,094
Thank you for coming.

57
00:04:07,095 --> 00:04:09,094
Am I right?

58
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:11,094
I don't know.

59
00:04:11,095 --> 00:04:13,095
Isn't it Eunchae?

60
00:04:13,096 --> 00:04:15,095
Eunchae.

61
00:04:15,096 --> 00:04:17,095
I'm the first one.

62
00:04:17,096 --> 00:04:19,095
Eunchae.

63
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:21,095
I did it first.

64
00:04:21,096 --> 00:04:23,096
I won.

65
00:04:25,096 --> 00:04:27,096
Crazy Red.

66
00:04:27,097 --> 00:04:29,096
Back in the days.

67
00:04:29,097 --> 00:04:31,096
Don't be crazy.

68
00:04:31,097 --> 00:04:33,096
I can't do it anymore.

69
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:35,096
I can't do it anymore.

70
00:04:35,097 --> 00:04:37,097
A word in Japanese for Kkura.

71
00:04:39,097 --> 00:04:41,098
Good night.

72
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:45,097
Birthday?

73
00:04:45,098 --> 00:04:47,097
Who's birthday is it today?

74
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:49,097
Today, Nolto's Crazy came out?

75
00:04:49,098 --> 00:04:51,097
Why?

76
00:04:51,098 --> 00:04:53,097
Why?

77
00:04:53,098 --> 00:04:55,098
Did it come out as sea writing?

78
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,099
It's not hard.

79
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:07,098
Oh, really?

80
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:09,098
Oh, really?

81
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:11,099
Where is this part?

82
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,099
Where did it come out?

83
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,099
Where did it come out?

84
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,099
I don't know.

85
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,099
Is it.

86
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,099
Oh, here it is.

87
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,099
I ate meat today.

88
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,100
But I suddenly want to eat cherries.

89
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:27,100
I suddenly want to eat cherries.

90
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:29,100
I wanted to eat cherries.

91
00:05:29,101 --> 00:05:31,100
I ordered cherries just now.

92
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:33,100
We've been on a diet for a long time.

93
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:35,100
We've been on a diet for a long time.

94
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,100
I've been on a diet for a long time.

95
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:39,100
Everybody has to eat again...

96
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:41,101
It's been a long time, but I've
been on a diet for a long time.

97
00:05:41,102 --> 00:05:43,101
I don't remember when it was.

98
00:05:43,102 --> 00:05:45,101
Q. Are you doing a secret live broadcast?

99
00:05:45,102 --> 00:05:51,101
Secret live broadcast? No, I
don't do it secretly. Be confident.

100
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:55,102
Q. You said you were going to sleep.

101
00:05:55,103 --> 00:05:59,102
You said you were going
to sleep. I ordered cherries.

102
00:05:59,103 --> 00:06:05,102
No, I'm going to play with Fearnot,
eat some cherries, and go to bed.

103
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:11,103
Q. What kind of music do you like?

104
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,103
Ferrari girl

105
00:06:13,104 --> 00:06:16,103
Q. What? Who is this?

106
00:06:16,104 --> 00:06:19,104
Why am I Ferrari girl?

107
00:06:24,105 --> 00:06:28,105
Q. You don't cry and you talk well.

108
00:06:41,106 --> 00:06:44,105
Q. What kind of music do you like?

109
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:46,105
Cafe

110
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:49,105
Q. What kind of music do you like?

111
00:06:49,106 --> 00:06:51,105
Ferrari girl

112
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:53,105
I can't buy a Ferrari.

113
00:06:53,106 --> 00:07:00,106
Q. What kind of drama
do you watch these days?

114
00:07:00,107 --> 00:07:04,106
I'm watching Sunji's Flower Trio right now.

115
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:08,107
Q. What kind of drama
do you watch these days?

116
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:10,107
It's a little behind the scenes.

117
00:07:10,108 --> 00:07:15,107
I'm watching it.

118
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:20,107
Q. What kind of drama do you like?

119
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:23,108
I know it's a lot.

120
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,108
Q. What kind of drama do you like?

121
00:07:25,109 --> 00:07:28,108
That's right. That's a lot.

122
00:07:28,109 --> 00:07:30,108
I know.

123
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:32,108
Q. What kind of drama do you like?

124
00:07:32,109 --> 00:07:35,108
I haven't seen Black and White Cook.

125
00:07:35,109 --> 00:07:37,108
Q. What kind of drama do you like?

126
00:07:37,109 --> 00:07:39,109
Black and White Cook.

127
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,609
I don't know. They say it's so much fun.

128
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,109
All the members around
me say it's so much fun.

129
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,609
They're all talking about it.

130
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,609
They're copying it.

131
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,610
And if I say I haven't seen it yet,

132
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:54,610
You're still happy.

133
00:07:54,611 --> 00:07:57,610
That's what they're saying.

134
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:02,610
I thought it was a
cooking and judging show.

135
00:08:02,611 --> 00:08:05,610
I haven't seen it yet.

136
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:10,611
I'm not interested in it yet.

137
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:14,612
I've seen the movie of tears.

138
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:30,613
Eunchae sings.

139
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:35,612
So cute.

140
00:08:35,613 --> 00:08:37,613
The comments are so cute.

141
00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:39,614
Eunchae sings. Touch.

142
00:08:55,615 --> 00:08:58,615
Eunchae, please teach
me how to speak English well.

143
00:09:01,615 --> 00:09:03,615
I don't know.

144
00:09:06,616 --> 00:09:07,615
Please.

145
00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:08,616
Me, too.

146
00:09:21,617 --> 00:09:23,616
Sing me a celebrity.

147
00:09:23,617 --> 00:09:24,616
Celebrity.

148
00:09:24,617 --> 00:09:27,616
But when I was on a celebrity stage,

149
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:29,616
I wrote the lyrics and sang it.

150
00:09:29,617 --> 00:09:31,616
I'll be your station.

151
00:09:31,617 --> 00:09:33,616
I'll make you smile
for the rest of your life.

152
00:09:33,617 --> 00:09:34,616
Something like this.

153
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:36,617
I sang it in the lyrics.

154
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:37,617
So...

155
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:41,617
But originally, I didn't know the song.

156
00:09:41,618 --> 00:09:43,617
The original lyrics.

157
00:09:43,618 --> 00:09:45,617
I don't remember.

158
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:46,617
So...

159
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:50,618
I'll be your celebrity.

160
00:09:50,619 --> 00:09:52,618
I'll make you smile
for the rest of your life.

161
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:54,618
Acting and singing.

162
00:09:54,619 --> 00:09:56,619
It's a comedy.

163
00:09:57,619 --> 00:09:59,619
I'll make you smile.

164
00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:02,619
That's what it was.

165
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,619
You made me smile.

166
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,619
I'll make you smile
for the rest of your life.

167
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,620
Um...

168
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,619
Anyway.

169
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,619
Next.

170
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,619
What song did you sing back then?

171
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,619
I sang,

172
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,300
eel boat

173
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,620
what?

174
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,620
I was swimming.

175
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:23,620
Yes,

176
00:10:23,621 --> 00:10:24,620
Like this.

177
00:10:24,621 --> 00:10:27,621
Divided into two songs is

178
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:30,620
I sang it two times in one part.

179
00:10:30,621 --> 00:10:32,620
Why didn't you make me sing
when you just sang a part again?

180
00:10:32,621 --> 00:10:34,821
I borrowed it.

181
00:10:34,822 --> 00:10:39,822
Hong Hee-jung, Hong-sam,
Hong-gil-dong, something like that.

182
00:10:43,322 --> 00:10:44,321
You know, right?

183
00:10:47,222 --> 00:10:48,922
Speak Chinese, please.

184
00:10:49,923 --> 00:10:51,923
Thank you. I love you.

185
00:10:52,423 --> 00:10:54,023
See you in China.

186
00:10:59,123 --> 00:11:00,222
Please call me.

187
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,422
You made a kiss me.

188
00:11:01,423 --> 00:11:03,523
You made a kiss me.

189
00:11:04,524 --> 00:11:05,623
Is this right?

190
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,124
Your lover...

191
00:11:09,124 --> 00:11:10,423
You made a kiss me.

192
00:11:10,424 --> 00:11:11,624
I see.

193
00:11:13,224 --> 00:11:14,823
You made a kiss me.

194
00:11:14,824 --> 00:11:16,823
Na na na kiss me.

195
00:11:16,824 --> 00:11:19,525
I'm sorry...

196
00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:22,524
Welcome.

197
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:24,825
Actually, I don't know the lyrics.

198
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:29,224
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na.

199
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:31,225
Please, please.

200
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,426
You want to kiss me?

201
00:11:36,426 --> 00:11:38,466
I want you to wish me a
happy birthday in Japanese.

202
00:11:39,426 --> 00:11:41,425
Happy birthday!

203
00:11:41,426 --> 00:11:43,425
Nemo Nemo, Nemo Nemo sign.

204
00:11:43,426 --> 00:11:45,425
Nemo Nemo, Nemo Nemo.

205
00:11:45,426 --> 00:11:47,426
Bunce munce.

206
00:11:54,427 --> 00:11:56,426
It's not a content if I sing.

207
00:11:56,427 --> 00:11:58,427
What should I write?

208
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,427
What should I write?

209
00:12:04,428 --> 00:12:06,428
Mm-hmm.

210
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:21,429
You're not ready to sleep soon?

211
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:24,428
Not yet.

212
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:26,428
It's not that much.

213
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:29,429
I'm turning it on in my room.

214
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,429
What's your favorite nickname these days?

215
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,429
I'm Hoon-chae.

216
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,430
Hoon-chae. Hoon-chae.

217
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:49,431
Hoon-chae.

218
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:55,430
Hoon-chae.

219
00:12:55,431 --> 00:12:57,430
Who made that?

220
00:12:57,431 --> 00:12:59,430
I think it's well made.

221
00:12:59,431 --> 00:13:01,430
Did you like it?

222
00:13:01,431 --> 00:13:03,431
Hoon High School?

223
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:05,432
Do you call it Hoon High School?

224
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:07,431
Oh, Daehari?

225
00:13:07,432 --> 00:13:08,431
It's not Daehari.

226
00:13:08,432 --> 00:13:09,431
I'm sorry.

227
00:13:09,432 --> 00:13:12,431
Daehari isn't my nickname.

228
00:13:12,432 --> 00:13:14,432
Hoon High School.

229
00:13:16,432 --> 00:13:18,432
Hoon-chae like Hoon?

230
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:19,432
No.

231
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:21,432
It's Hoon Hoon High School.

232
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:22,432
Isn't it?

233
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:25,432
It's Hoon Hoon High School because
it's Hoon Hoon High School, right?

234
00:13:25,433 --> 00:13:27,432
Hoon High School?

235
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:29,433
Are you making fun of me?

236
00:13:32,434 --> 00:13:34,434
Hoon High School.

237
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:40,433
Hoon High School to the training center?

238
00:13:40,434 --> 00:13:41,433
What are you talking about?

239
00:13:41,434 --> 00:13:42,433
Don't say anything.

240
00:13:42,434 --> 00:13:43,433
Let's have a talk.

241
00:13:43,434 --> 00:13:44,433
Ah, Hoon High School?

242
00:13:44,434 --> 00:13:45,433
Are you a Hoon High School?

243
00:13:45,434 --> 00:13:46,434
Wait a minute.

244
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:47,434
It's Hoon Hoon High School.

245
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:48,434
Oh, yeah?

246
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:49,434
It's not Hoon Hoon High School?

247
00:13:49,435 --> 00:13:50,434
I don't know.

248
00:13:50,435 --> 00:13:51,434
Do you have a hobby these days?

249
00:13:51,435 --> 00:13:52,434
Hobby these days?

250
00:13:52,435 --> 00:13:53,434
Accommodation?

251
00:13:53,435 --> 00:13:54,434
Accommodation?

252
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:55,434
Hmm.

253
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:56,434
Well.

254
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:57,434
I'm not sure.

255
00:13:57,435 --> 00:13:58,434
Oh, yeah.

256
00:13:58,435 --> 00:13:59,434
I'm not sure.

257
00:13:59,435 --> 00:14:00,434
I'm not sure.

258
00:14:00,435 --> 00:14:01,435
Do you have a hobby these days?

259
00:14:01,436 --> 00:14:02,435
Did you do anything?

260
00:14:02,436 --> 00:14:03,435
No.

261
00:14:03,436 --> 00:14:06,435
No, when did you get off work?

262
00:14:06,436 --> 00:14:07,435
I'm working.

263
00:14:07,436 --> 00:14:08,435
I'm working.

264
00:14:08,436 --> 00:14:09,435
I work.

265
00:14:09,436 --> 00:14:10,435
Are you an entertainer?

266
00:14:10,436 --> 00:14:11,435
Yeah.

267
00:14:11,436 --> 00:14:12,435
Yeah.

268
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:20,437
I miss you, Eunchae. I miss you, too.

269
00:14:22,437 --> 00:14:26,436
I miss you, too.

270
00:14:26,437 --> 00:14:34,438
How can you remember that there
are three nail clubs in your nickname?

271
00:14:35,438 --> 00:14:43,438
Favorite cartoon? I don't
watch cartoons often.

272
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:53,439
Wait a minute. Say something to the unnies
who bought white hoodies because of Eunchae.

273
00:14:54,439 --> 00:15:02,439
What is this? Really.
What is this? What is it?

274
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,439
What should I do?

275
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,439
What should I do?

276
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:13,440
At that time, that white hoodie unni was
really awesome. I could only see that unni.

277
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:17,440
It's really funny.

278
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:20,440
Did you really buy a white hoodie?

279
00:15:20,441 --> 00:15:23,440
Oh, really.

280
00:15:23,441 --> 00:15:27,440
It's not a blotting.

281
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:29,441
Are you crazy? Are you crazy?

282
00:15:29,442 --> 00:15:31,441
Why?

283
00:15:31,442 --> 00:15:34,441
Why? What?

284
00:15:34,442 --> 00:15:36,441
Why?

285
00:15:36,442 --> 00:15:39,441
Oh, why?

286
00:15:39,442 --> 00:15:43,441
Why did you buy a bright gray hoodie?

287
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,442
You know.

288
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,442
It's not white.

289
00:15:45,443 --> 00:15:47,442
It's not white.

290
00:15:47,443 --> 00:15:49,442
The bright gray one.

291
00:15:49,443 --> 00:15:51,442
You know what ash is, right?

292
00:15:51,443 --> 00:15:53,442
It's not gray, but it's a
really bright gray hoodie.

293
00:15:53,443 --> 00:15:56,442
It was a zip-up.

294
00:15:56,443 --> 00:15:59,443
It was a zip-up.

295
00:15:59,444 --> 00:16:00,443
It was a zip-up.

296
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:01,443
It was a zip-up.

297
00:16:01,444 --> 00:16:02,443
It was a zip-up.

298
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:10,444
I saw it in detail, but I didn't see it
in detail, but I was sitting in a row.

299
00:16:21,445 --> 00:16:29,445
It's not a blotting, it's really...
Everyone, I'll explain what it is.

300
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:33,445
Don't say anything
and listen. I'll explain.

301
00:16:33,446 --> 00:16:39,445
Do you want me to say
something? I'll explain.

302
00:16:39,446 --> 00:16:47,447
It's been a long time since we had a university
event, and there were schools that went far away.

303
00:16:48,447 --> 00:16:56,447
We're on stage, but we've gained a lot
of good energy and a lot of good things.

304
00:16:58,448 --> 00:16:59,447
It's been a long time since we've been on stage, but we've
gained a lot of good energy and a lot of good things.

305
00:16:59,448 --> 00:17:02,447
We prepared our autographed
albums for each school.

306
00:17:02,448 --> 00:17:10,447
I wanted to pick someone who enjoyed it so much and
give them a gift, so I prepared an autographed album.

307
00:17:10,448 --> 00:17:18,449
So now, it's time to pick the person
to give the autographed album.

308
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:28,449
But I'm not lying.

309
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,449
I'm not lying.

310
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:37,450
There was a person who stood out from the moment
I took the first pose to start the anti-fans.

311
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:48,451
But now that there are so many people, it was really hard for
us to pick two or three people for this autographed album.

312
00:17:49,451 --> 00:17:53,450
So it's really hard to choose.

313
00:17:53,451 --> 00:17:54,450
Oh, I'm really...

314
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:58,451
From the moment I came on
stage, it was so eye-catching.

315
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,451
I took a hard-core picture.

316
00:18:00,452 --> 00:18:05,451
Because the能� הכ받이
people are so cute in front of me.

317
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:10,451
What should I do if there are
so many people around me?

318
00:18:10,452 --> 00:18:12,452
I have to think about
it included in my life.

319
00:18:12,453 --> 00:18:16,452
And when I say a word that suits
this song, I have nothing against it.

320
00:18:16,453 --> 00:18:18,452
Thekimuan moments.

321
00:18:18,453 --> 00:18:21,452
When I was kind of jealous,
people around me said,

322
00:18:21,453 --> 00:18:22,452
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

323
00:18:22,453 --> 00:18:24,452
If you're jealous of this songs, come here.

324
00:18:24,453 --> 00:18:26,453
Hey, don't be jealous.

325
00:18:26,454 --> 00:18:28,893
What's the next stage name?

326
00:18:28,894 --> 00:18:34,573
Oh, I'm going crazy.

327
00:18:34,574 --> 00:18:40,453
And it's a college festival, so if you're
a college student, you're older than me.

328
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:47,894
And the fact that I'm in the first row means that
I'm the older sister of my student at the school.

329
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:52,214
And I have a lot of affection for you.

330
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:56,415
That's right.

331
00:18:56,416 --> 00:19:04,416
Oh, I'm going crazy.

332
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:20,697
Guys, let's talk about something else.

333
00:19:21,737 --> 00:19:26,097
I wanted to treat you gently
rather than affectionately.

334
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:26,218
Also, I wanted to tell you that I love you.

335
00:19:26,218 --> 00:19:26,338
I wanted to tell you that I love you.

336
00:19:26,338 --> 00:19:26,376
I wanted to tell you that I love you.

337
00:19:26,377 --> 00:19:26,418
I wanted to tell you that I love you.

338
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:27,657
We're like best friends.

339
00:19:27,658 --> 00:19:29,297
It's a fun atmosphere and
we're all of the same age.

340
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:33,317
It's a fun atmosphere and
we're all of the same age.

341
00:19:33,318 --> 00:19:35,177
I wanted to treat you gently.

342
00:19:35,178 --> 00:19:43,179
I wanted to treat you gently.

343
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:49,178
Oh, please don't make a face like that!

344
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:50,978
Apron

345
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:55,159
face mask

346
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,400
no, you can't have it on
your méthode Adeleisse

347
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,419
I'm not crying.

348
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,359
06.

349
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,360
06.

350
00:20:09,781 --> 00:20:11,780
06.

351
00:20:11,781 --> 00:20:13,780
Do you have any friends?

352
00:20:13,781 --> 00:20:15,780
06.

353
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,780
06.

354
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:19,780
06.

355
00:20:19,781 --> 00:20:21,780
06.

356
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:23,780
06.

357
00:20:23,781 --> 00:20:25,781
06.

358
00:20:25,782 --> 00:20:27,782
I'm sorry.

359
00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:38,783
96?

360
00:20:40,783 --> 00:20:42,783
96? I think it's the last one.

361
00:20:55,784 --> 00:20:57,784
I'm sorry.

362
00:21:02,784 --> 00:21:04,784
It's October's birthday.

363
00:21:06,784 --> 00:21:08,784
It's October 27th.

364
00:21:08,785 --> 00:21:10,784
Congratulations.

365
00:21:10,785 --> 00:21:12,784
Congratulations, Miri.

366
00:21:12,785 --> 00:21:14,785
Congratulations, Miri.

367
00:21:16,785 --> 00:21:18,785
Are you listening?

368
00:21:21,785 --> 00:21:23,785
Congratulations, Miri.

369
00:21:23,786 --> 00:21:25,786
It's still October.

370
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,786
Although it's May 5th.

371
00:21:30,786 --> 00:21:32,786
There are a lot of
birthdays when it's cold.

372
00:21:44,787 --> 00:21:46,786
Congratulations, everyone.

373
00:21:46,787 --> 00:21:48,787
Do you have a challenge you want to do?

374
00:21:49,787 --> 00:21:51,786
Do you have a challenge you want to do?

375
00:21:51,787 --> 00:21:53,788
A challenge you want to do?

376
00:21:55,788 --> 00:21:57,788
I want to do a touch.

377
00:21:58,788 --> 00:22:00,788
I want to do a touch challenge.

378
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,787
What are the challenges these days?

379
00:22:04,788 --> 00:22:08,788
But not the dance
challenges of other groups.

380
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:11,789
What's the challenge that's
really popular these days?

381
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:17,789
Nemo, Nemo, Nemo, Nemo.

382
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,790
Nemo.

383
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,790
Actually most of És Wild.

384
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,789
If you're an MC, the
challenge you want to do is...

385
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,790
The dance challenge
you want to do islegeness.

386
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,790
Nemo, Nemo, Nemo, Nemo.

387
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:47,791
Teenage group

388
00:22:50,191 --> 00:22:51,512
Teny They're waiting screen time.

389
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:53,791
Teny Good night.

390
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:58,791
What is it? I need to look it up.

391
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:03,791
What is it? I need to look it up.

392
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:08,792
What is it? I need to look it up.

393
00:23:08,793 --> 00:23:13,792
What is it? I need to look it up.

394
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:18,792
What is it? I need to look it up.

395
00:23:18,793 --> 00:23:23,793
What is it? I need to look it up.

396
00:23:23,794 --> 00:23:28,793
What is it? I need to look it up.

397
00:23:28,794 --> 00:23:33,793
What is it?

398
00:23:33,794 --> 00:23:38,794
What is it? I need to look it up.

399
00:23:38,795 --> 00:23:42,794
Oh, I'm sorry.

400
00:23:42,795 --> 00:23:46,794
Yeah, I'm sorry.

401
00:23:46,795 --> 00:23:50,795
I don't know what to say.

402
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:54,795
I'm sorry.

403
00:23:54,796 --> 00:23:58,795
Well, that's it.

404
00:23:58,796 --> 00:24:02,795
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

405
00:24:02,796 --> 00:24:06,796
I'm sorry.

406
00:24:06,797 --> 00:24:09,797
It's going to be cut off?

407
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:13,797
I wasn't talking yet.

408
00:24:18,797 --> 00:24:20,797
The weather is really nice.

409
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:23,798
The weather is nice.

410
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:31,797
What movie do you recommend?

411
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:36,799
For me, Inside Out and...

412
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,798
It's not serious at all.

413
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:46,799
It's a cute and fun movie.

414
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:50,800
There's a movie called Yes Day.

415
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Was it when I was in elementary school?

416
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:00,800
It's a movie that my teacher showed me
in class when I was in elementary school.

417
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
My family...

418
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:07,800
My family...

419
00:25:07,801 --> 00:25:09,800
Once a year?

420
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,800
So we decided on Yes Day.

421
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,800
So on that day, we can always say yes.

422
00:25:14,801 --> 00:25:16,800
We can only say yes.

423
00:25:16,801 --> 00:25:18,801
On that day.

424
00:25:18,802 --> 00:25:20,802
So...

425
00:25:21,802 --> 00:25:24,801
So once a year, once a day,

426
00:25:24,802 --> 00:25:26,801
There are things I really wanted to do.

427
00:25:26,802 --> 00:25:28,801
There are things I can't even imagine.

428
00:25:28,802 --> 00:25:30,801
Buying ice cream for each taste.

429
00:25:30,802 --> 00:25:32,801
Eating ice cream for each taste.

430
00:25:32,802 --> 00:25:34,803
It's a day like that.

431
00:25:35,803 --> 00:25:37,802
Because I can only say yes.

432
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:39,803
I have to follow everything.

433
00:25:40,803 --> 00:25:43,802
Anyway, there's a lot of movies like that.

434
00:25:43,803 --> 00:25:45,802
So it's just cute.

435
00:25:45,803 --> 00:25:47,802
It's not really serious.

436
00:25:47,803 --> 00:25:48,803
Just...

437
00:25:48,804 --> 00:25:49,804
What should I say?

438
00:25:50,804 --> 00:25:51,803
Just once.

439
00:25:51,804 --> 00:25:52,804
Just...

440
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:54,803
When I'm bored?

441
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:55,804
Let's see.

442
00:25:58,804 --> 00:25:59,803
It looks fun.

443
00:25:59,804 --> 00:26:00,804
When I close my eyes?

444
00:26:01,804 --> 00:26:03,804
I can sleep in peace.

445
00:26:03,805 --> 00:26:05,805
SSD

446
00:26:06,805 --> 00:26:07,804
So cute.

447
00:26:07,805 --> 00:26:08,804
Very cute.

448
00:26:08,805 --> 00:26:09,805
All under one roof.

449
00:26:15,805 --> 00:26:16,804
A snowflake?

450
00:26:16,805 --> 00:26:17,805
Yes.

451
00:26:17,806 --> 00:26:19,805
I don't have one.

452
00:26:19,806 --> 00:26:21,805
I don't have one.

453
00:26:21,806 --> 00:26:23,805
I don't have any need.

454
00:26:23,806 --> 00:26:25,805
To see me,

455
00:26:25,806 --> 00:26:27,805
If I don't have anything...

456
00:26:27,806 --> 00:26:30,586
By U-BANG and Starrywhee

457
00:26:31,806 --> 00:26:34,807
Above all, it's so...

458
00:26:37,907 --> 00:26:40,467
Paper...

459
00:26:42,387 --> 00:26:44,287
I was surprised.

460
00:26:44,907 --> 00:26:47,888
So...

461
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:52,607
But still, the same, the same as other

462
00:26:52,608 --> 00:26:54,887
I got the ticket,

463
00:26:54,888 --> 00:27:02,268
I didn't think I'd be able to get a lot of
sightings because I was on my way to the concert.

464
00:27:02,269 --> 00:27:05,408
But I didn't know there would
be so many articles about me.

465
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:09,328
I was so embarrassed.

466
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:13,768
I'm really bad at self-makeup.

467
00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:18,729
It was fun.

468
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,329
But I won the day.

469
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:25,569
But the weather was really
nice and it was so much fun.

470
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:33,571
And I just went to the beach with
my mom and brother to get some air.

471
00:27:43,951 --> 00:27:49,971
There's a place with a baton.

472
00:27:49,972 --> 00:27:50,272
So I went to the beach to get some air.

473
00:27:50,272 --> 00:27:50,290
So I went to the beach to get some air.

474
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:50,332
So I went to the beach to get some air.

475
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:52,491
And I did it with my brother.

476
00:27:52,492 --> 00:27:55,611
I did a lot of things, but my
brother was really bad at it.

477
00:27:55,612 --> 00:27:57,371
I did a lot of things, but my
brother was really bad at it.

478
00:27:57,372 --> 00:27:59,951
So I won everything.

479
00:27:59,952 --> 00:28:03,432
I took it without any time.

480
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:07,672
It's so funny that I took
it with the fast-forward.

481
00:28:07,673 --> 00:28:12,432
It's so funny.

482
00:28:12,433 --> 00:28:16,113
And what else?

483
00:28:16,114 --> 00:28:20,293
I just met a lot of family members.

484
00:28:20,294 --> 00:28:28,293
Other than my mom, dad, and my brother,
I've met a lot of relatives this time.

485
00:28:28,294 --> 00:28:36,295
There are families that I see often, but there
are also people that I haven't seen in years.

486
00:28:41,895 --> 00:28:45,575
I think I've met a lot of family members.

487
00:28:45,576 --> 00:28:51,135
The moon photo was at the beach in Sokcho.

488
00:28:51,136 --> 00:28:56,375
On the way home from Sokcho, I
took a really cool picture of the moon.

489
00:28:56,376 --> 00:29:01,656
I also played bowling.

490
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:09,657
Me, Eunche, Eunche's cousin, 1st
cousin, 2nd cousin, and I played bowling.

491
00:29:10,857 --> 00:29:14,697
Was it fun?

492
00:29:14,698 --> 00:29:15,298
Yeah.

493
00:29:15,298 --> 00:29:15,518
Yeah.

494
00:29:15,518 --> 00:29:15,536
Yeah.

495
00:29:15,537 --> 00:29:15,558
Was it fun?

496
00:29:15,578 --> 00:29:23,578
Do you have a favorite
baseball cheerleader?

497
00:29:25,578 --> 00:29:31,578
I sang a lot of cheerleaders that day, too.

498
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:35,578
I sang along to all of them.

499
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:41,578
But I forgot to go.

500
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:47,579
I forgot to go.

501
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,580
Favorite? I like all of them.

502
00:30:09,581 --> 00:30:11,580
You know all of them.

503
00:30:11,581 --> 00:30:13,582
How do I know?

504
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:39,582
It's been a long time since I exercised.

505
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:41,582
It's been a long time since I exercised.

506
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:43,583
It's been a long time since I exercised.

507
00:30:43,584 --> 00:30:45,583
I exercised before the vacation.

508
00:30:45,584 --> 00:30:47,583
I exercised before the vacation.

509
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:49,583
I exercised after the vacation.

510
00:30:49,584 --> 00:30:51,583
I exercised because I didn't do anything.

511
00:30:51,584 --> 00:30:53,584
I exercised because I didn't do anything.

512
00:31:05,585 --> 00:31:09,584
I exercised a lot when I was a trainee.

513
00:31:09,585 --> 00:31:13,585
It's really hard to start over,

514
00:31:13,586 --> 00:31:15,585
It's really hard to start over,

515
00:31:15,586 --> 00:31:17,585
But I want you to try it.

516
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:19,585
It's good.

517
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,585
But I want you to try this.

518
00:31:21,586 --> 00:31:23,585
This is not the best.

519
00:31:23,586 --> 00:31:25,585
I am sorry.

520
00:31:25,586 --> 00:31:27,586
It is。

521
00:31:27,587 --> 00:31:29,586
I'm sorry,

522
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,586
I'm sorry,

523
00:31:31,587 --> 00:31:33,586
I forgot the name of this game.

524
00:31:33,587 --> 00:31:35,586
I thought it was not a life I was doing.

525
00:31:35,587 --> 00:31:37,586
I'm sorry.

526
00:31:37,587 --> 00:31:45,588
But I really want to go to
the baseball field again.

527
00:31:47,588 --> 00:31:49,587
I want to go again.

528
00:31:49,588 --> 00:31:57,588
I want to go to the baseball field again.

529
00:31:57,589 --> 00:32:03,588
It's a shame, but I really
have to go next year.

530
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:10,588
Chosu-haek, Chosu-haek,
Chosu-haek, Chosu-haek, Chosu-haek.

531
00:32:10,589 --> 00:32:15,589
Andachi-hudo, and lalalalala.

532
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:18,590
That day was...

533
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,589
It was so awesome.

534
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,589
It was a fun game.

535
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,589
The weather was nice.

536
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,590
The weather was nice.

537
00:32:27,591 --> 00:32:31,591
It was an interesting and fun game.

538
00:32:33,591 --> 00:32:35,931
The seaweed soup was really good, too.

539
00:32:58,953 --> 00:33:00,833
Did you take a selfie
at the baseball field?

540
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:03,093
I posted it on Instagram.

541
00:33:03,593 --> 00:33:05,593
I'm going to take a
selfie at the baseball field.

542
00:33:16,134 --> 00:33:18,134
Wow, 30 minutes have passed.

543
00:33:20,574 --> 00:33:21,574
Wow.

544
00:33:28,115 --> 00:33:30,115
It was Friday yesterday.

545
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:33,274
But for the first time,

546
00:33:33,275 --> 00:33:35,274
It's been a long time since I've
had another schedule on Friday.

547
00:33:35,275 --> 00:33:37,835
It's been a long time since I've
had another schedule on Friday.

548
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:39,876
I'm a little...

549
00:33:40,956 --> 00:33:42,956
I had no choice but to...

550
00:33:43,616 --> 00:33:45,616
I felt a little bit sad.

551
00:33:47,556 --> 00:33:49,556
I think it was the same for you.

552
00:33:51,636 --> 00:33:53,636
I just came to play today.

553
00:34:00,317 --> 00:34:02,317
Did you have fun?

554
00:34:03,277 --> 00:34:04,277
But I think I was a little...

555
00:34:04,297 --> 00:34:05,977
Let's keep this confidential.

556
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:12,178
My husband's sniveling
love for me was a little...

557
00:34:15,278 --> 00:34:17,278
It's not as bad as you think...

558
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:25,679
Give me a hug.

559
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,238
Give me a hug.

560
00:34:29,959 --> 00:34:31,558
Someone told me that if I hate you...

561
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:31,879
Oh, there's someone.

562
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:32,339
There's an under Yang.

563
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:32,919
What do I do?

564
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:33,099
There's someone I just
had aning to out in the group.

565
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:33,239
Oh, there's someone.

566
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:33,279
Oh, there's someone.

567
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,519
The rider said he started delivering.

568
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,300
Oh, the Japanese I've learned recently.

569
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,581
I always forget and always...

570
00:34:54,781 --> 00:34:58,960
Fans asked me so much about
the Japanese I've learned recently.

571
00:34:58,961 --> 00:35:00,320
I...

572
00:35:00,321 --> 00:35:08,121
Now I'm trying to memorize the Japanese I've
learned recently while talking with my unnies.

573
00:35:08,122 --> 00:35:13,921
I try to memorize it and when I ask again later,
I say I should answer like this at that time.

574
00:35:13,922 --> 00:35:16,922
Oh, but I really forgot again.

575
00:35:17,922 --> 00:35:19,361
I learned... Oh, there was something.

576
00:35:19,362 --> 00:35:21,721
Do you know what is the
Japanese word for water crab?

577
00:35:21,722 --> 00:35:22,722
Everyone.

578
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:26,923
Water crab. It was a water crab.

579
00:35:27,923 --> 00:35:29,222
What is a water crab?

580
00:35:29,223 --> 00:35:29,723
That...

581
00:35:29,723 --> 00:35:30,223
Oh, really.

582
00:35:30,223 --> 00:35:30,723
What was it?

583
00:35:30,724 --> 00:35:33,122
I always remember this
because it's really dark.

584
00:35:33,123 --> 00:35:34,122
I remember, I remember, I remember.

585
00:35:34,123 --> 00:35:35,422
I do this, but...

586
00:35:35,423 --> 00:35:37,122
After I got here?

587
00:35:37,123 --> 00:35:39,124
After I got here, it's cotton candy.

588
00:35:44,324 --> 00:35:46,124
It's not a water crab.

589
00:35:47,224 --> 00:35:48,223
Mijino?

590
00:35:50,024 --> 00:35:51,123
Water dog?

591
00:35:51,124 --> 00:35:52,124
No, it's not.

592
00:35:54,225 --> 00:35:54,825
Ajarashi.

593
00:35:54,826 --> 00:35:56,924
I think it was ajarashi.

594
00:35:56,925 --> 00:36:00,824
I think it was ajarashi.

595
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,824
That's right.

596
00:36:01,825 --> 00:36:03,825
Thank you.

597
00:36:07,826 --> 00:36:12,825
Anyway, I think it was ajarashi.

598
00:36:12,826 --> 00:36:14,825
What's your favorite snack these days?

599
00:36:14,826 --> 00:36:16,825
What's your favorite snack these days?

600
00:36:16,826 --> 00:36:20,825
I really like fried rice cakes
and nurungji these days.

601
00:36:20,826 --> 00:36:21,826
Nurungji.

602
00:36:21,827 --> 00:36:22,826
I like nurungji and fried rice cakes.

603
00:36:22,827 --> 00:36:23,926
I like nurungji and fried rice cakes.

604
00:36:23,927 --> 00:36:24,926
I like nurungji and fried rice cakes.

605
00:36:24,927 --> 00:36:25,926
Fried rice cakes.

606
00:36:25,927 --> 00:36:30,026
Yesterday, my manager bought
me a really delicious fried rice cake.

607
00:36:30,027 --> 00:36:35,226
It was really delicious.

608
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:42,027
That's what me and the other
manager and two people...

609
00:36:42,028 --> 00:36:43,327
The long bag...

610
00:36:43,328 --> 00:36:47,427
You usually sell that long bag like this.

611
00:36:47,428 --> 00:36:50,427
I ate it all.

612
00:36:50,428 --> 00:36:54,228
I ate it all on the spot.

613
00:36:54,229 --> 00:36:55,549
It's not a human fried rice cake.

614
00:36:55,929 --> 00:36:56,629
It's not a human fried rice cake.

615
00:36:56,629 --> 00:36:57,529
It's really...

616
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,528
It melts in your mouth.

617
00:36:59,529 --> 00:37:00,728
It melts when you put it in your mouth.

618
00:37:00,729 --> 00:37:01,928
It's really thin.

619
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:03,928
It's really sweet and savory.

620
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:04,929
It was really delicious.

621
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,229
Anyway, that's it, everyone.

622
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,230
Are you doing well?

623
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,929
Isn't it almost 12 o'clock?

624
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:17,930
It's almost 12 o'clock.

625
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:19,929
You should sleep.

626
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:22,230
Eunchi, I'm going to bed.

627
00:37:22,231 --> 00:37:23,230
Yeah.

628
00:37:24,431 --> 00:37:25,430
All right.

629
00:37:25,931 --> 00:37:26,930
What are you doing?

630
00:37:26,931 --> 00:37:29,171
Of course, I'm going to eat
cherries before I go to bed.

631
00:37:37,432 --> 00:37:43,931
I'm going to eat cherries before I go to
bed, but you guys should go to bed early.

632
00:37:43,932 --> 00:37:44,931
All right?

633
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:48,931
Did you have fun today?

634
00:37:48,932 --> 00:37:50,932
I guess the cherries are all here.

635
00:37:50,933 --> 00:37:51,433
That's right.

636
00:37:51,434 --> 00:37:53,932
We're almost there.

637
00:37:53,933 --> 00:37:54,932
Bye.

638
00:37:54,933 --> 00:37:56,932
Did you have fun today?

639
00:37:56,933 --> 00:37:57,932
Good night.

640
00:37:57,933 --> 00:37:58,932
Have a good dream.

641
00:37:58,933 --> 00:37:59,932
Bye bye.

642
00:37:59,933 --> 00:38:00,933
I'll be back.

643
00:38:02,433 --> 00:38:03,432
Bye.

644
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:04,934
Bye, Chu.

645
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,693


646
00:00:20,473 --> 00:00:21,480
