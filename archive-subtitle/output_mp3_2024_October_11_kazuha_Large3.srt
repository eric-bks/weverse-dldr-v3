11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,440
I didn't even

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,440
expect it

13
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,440
I didn't even expect it

14
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,440
My hair is

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,440
doing the choreography

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,440
right now

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,440
It's a bit

18
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,440
but

19
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,440
All of a sudden?

20
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,440
All of a sudden

21
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,440
It's all good

22
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,440
The choreography

23
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,440
will be

24
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,440
tomorrow

00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,440
Golden Wave

00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:32,291

27
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,440
Right right

28
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,440
I practiced

29
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,440
What are you doing?

30
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,440
It's Friday afternoon

31
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,440
Hello

32
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,440
Hi

33
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,440
When we do

34
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,440
Confety

35
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,440
But

36
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,440
I want

37
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,440
to

38
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,440
So

39
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,440
So

40
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,440
We

41
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,400
I

42
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,440
now

43
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,440
This

44
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,440
This

45
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,360
I'm good. How are you? If you're not.

46
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,860
Hi.

47
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,860
Are you all busy right now?

48
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,860
There must be a lot of people who are going home after work.

49
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,360
Or are you still working?

50
00:02:43,418 --> 00:02:44,683


51
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
Every day.

52
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,360
Just living is amazing.

53
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,360
We...

54
00:02:51,941 --> 00:02:52,942


55
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,880


56
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,360
I'm studying, but I came to see you.

57
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
I came to see you.

58
00:03:05,046 --> 00:03:06,545


59
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
No.

60
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
I'm going to study.

61
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,360
Right.

62
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
Next month.

63
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,360
I'm going back to Osaka.

64
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,360
Oh, is it getting a little colder in Japan?

65
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,360
It's been a little chilly in Korea lately.

66
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,360
Zoya's bangs.

67
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,360
This is the bangs.

68
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
Now.

69
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Here's the bangs.

70
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,360
Bangs.

71
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,360
They're not bangs.

72
00:04:02,963 --> 00:04:04,756


73
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,360
Banks.

74
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,360
No bangs.

基本용 sign효과RAYA

76
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,360
I really wanted to go to Italy

77
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,360
I really did go

78
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:38,360
Originally, I wanted to go to Italy or somewhere like that

79
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:46,360
I wanted to go to a country that I've never been to before

80
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,360
So I thought about it

81
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,360
I wanted to go to Paris for my first vacation

82
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,360
So I went

83
00:05:00,582 --> 00:05:01,795


84
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,360
When I was studying abroad

85
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,360
When I was studying abroad

86
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
What was it?

87
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,360
Before I started my quarantine

88
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,360
I had a vacation at a ballet school

89
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,360
So at that time

90
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,360
My mom and dad came to the Netherlands

91
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,360
So I was there for about a week

92
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,360
I took a train with my parents

93
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,360
I went to Paris for the first time

94
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,360
I have a really good memory

95
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,360
So I wanted to go again

96
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
So this time

97
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,360
On the last day

98
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,360
For lunch

99
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,360
I had to eat

100
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,360
At that time

101
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,360
2 years? 2 years? 3 years?

102
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,360
Was it 3 years?

103
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,360
At that time

104
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,360
I went with my mom and dad

105
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,360
What was it?

106
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,360
What was the name?

107
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,360
Cascade?

108
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
Cascade?

109
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
Cascade?

110
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,360
Cascade?

111
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
That kind of name

112
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,360
Pie

113
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
That kind of food

114
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
That kind of food

115
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,360
That kind of

116
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
That kind of

117
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
That kind of

118
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,360
That kind of

119
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
I went

120
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,360
I went again

121
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,360
I don't know what I'm saying

122
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,360
So

123
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,360
I went again after 3 years

124
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
At that time

125
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,360
As a foreign student

126
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,360
With my mom and dad

127
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,360
For the first time

128
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,360
I went to Paris

129
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,360
We had dinner together

130
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,360
This time

131
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
The situation changed completely

132
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,360
With my mom

133
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
In the same restaurant

134
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
Eating the same food

135
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,360
I felt really weird

136
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,360
For me

137
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360
A meaningful

138
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,360
Restaurant

139
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
I think

140
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
That was it

141
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,360
Tzuhaya

142
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
When is the Luniverse coming out?

143
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,360
Luniverse?

144
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:24,168


145
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,360
The Luniverse

146
00:07:24,914 --> 00:07:27,108


147
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
You can really

148
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,360
Look forward to it

149
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,360
Look forward to it

150
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
Luniverse is really

151
00:07:33,198 --> 00:07:38,138


152
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
Really

153
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360
Incredible

154
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
Really really

155
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,360
It's more loyal than loyal

156
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
The staff of the staff

157
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
Really thank you

158
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,960
Thank you. Thank you and I love you.

159
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,460
There will be a lot of fun contents.

160
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,760
As always...

161
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,660
As always...

162
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:08,160
I think we'll be able to see a new side of us in a variety of ways.

163
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,660
Today's fashion? Today's fashion is so comfortable.

164
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,760
The theme is comfort.

165
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,560
The shoe thief.

166
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,060
Right. That...

167
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,360
It came out suddenly.

168
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,960
I was surprised too.

169
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,460
But it turned out well.

170
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,660
As expected.

171
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,260
I took it like this with the flip-flops.

172
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,060
It's really funny.

173
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,560
I didn't even imagine it at that time.

174
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,460
I didn't know the shoe thief would take it.

175
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,760
It really became a thief.

176
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,960
Chaewon.

177
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,260
Yes?

178
00:09:19,063 --> 00:09:21,550


179
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,160
I'm not playing games without you.

180
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,160
They were throwing their hands all over the table.

181
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,660
You'reiza.

182
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,560
Chaewon.

183
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,460
You should start off.

184
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,160
Then, do a favor.

185
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,060
When you hear Chaewon, you'll start touching it now.

186
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,160
Because you do it then.

187
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,060
socratic.

188
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,660
It came out

189
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,660
Unas episode

190
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,660
I took a tiktok with you earlier

191
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,660
Please wait a little

192
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,660
The monitor is the lighting?

193
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,660
Yes, it is

194
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,660
The monitor

195
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,660
My PC

196
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,660
The white background

197
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,660
Is my lighting

198
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,660
Right now

199
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,660
It's the white background

200
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,660
Like this

201
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,660
The blue background

202
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,660
The blue background is fine

203
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,660
No, the white background

204
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,660
The white background is too white

205
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,660
The blue background is fine

206
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,660
It's fine

207
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,660
The white background

208
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,660
Is definitely

209
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,660
Weakening the reflection

210
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,660
Your eyes are so shiny

211
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,660
Really?

212
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,660
Really?

213
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,660
Really?

214
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,660
Really?

215
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,660
Really?

216
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,660
Yes

217
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,660
No, really

218
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,660
No

219
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,660
What's the matter?

220
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,660
I was blah blah

221
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,660
I'm feeling bad

222
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,660
What are you naucing in front of this picture?

223
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,660
I'm a uber

224
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,660
Still

225
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,660
What's that?

226
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,660
Ah

227
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,660
Uh

228
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:37,660
As expected, I wanted to eat something warm because it was a little chilly.

229
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,660
Recommend me ice cream. Ice cream.

230
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,660
Pistachio ice cream.

231
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,660
Ice cream. I ate that last time.

232
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,660
The one they sell at the convenience store.

233
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,660
Dubai chocolate ice cream.

234
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,660
They sell it these days.

235
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,660
Yoonjin told me about it.

236
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,660
It was good.

237
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,660
I don't know what Dubai chocolate is.

238
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,660
I'll try it in the US.

239
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,660
The teacher bought it for me, so I ate it.

240
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,660
It was really good.

241
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,660
Dubai chocolate.

242
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,660
Is Dubai chocolate popular in Japan?

243
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,660
Is it popular all over the world?

244
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,660
I don't know.

245
00:12:50,660 --> 00:13:05,660
TT

246
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,660
Is Dubai chocolate popular?

247
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,660
It's popular. It's popular.

248
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,660
That means it's already popular?

249
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,660
You've seen it, right?

250
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,660
You've seen it with the members, right?

251
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,660
You've seen it with the members, right?

252
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,660
I want to eat croissant.

253
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,660
Do you want me to imitate you?

254
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,660
Do you want me to imitate you?

255
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,660
Who do you want to imitate?

256
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,660
I want to see your short hair.

257
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,660
Short hair?

258
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,660
I want to try it.

259
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,660
I want to try it, but if I do it,

260
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,660
it's a little...

261
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,660
How should I put it?

262
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,660
I think I'll look ugly.

263
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,660
No.

264
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,660
I think I'll look a lot uglier.

265
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,660
I think I'll look ugly.

266
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,660
It sounds like a good thing,

267
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,660
but it's not like that.

268
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,660
I think my image will change.

269
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,660
That's how it is.

270
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,660
Honey, it's not short hair.

271
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,660
It's not short hair.

272
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,660
You're sure.

273
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,660
All right, then.

274
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,660
Honesty.

275
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,660
Is it in the back?

276
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,660
Is it in the back?

277
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,660
Is it that again?

278
00:15:19,748 --> 00:15:21,749


279
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,660
Don't catch a cold.

280
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,660
Don't catch a cold.

281
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,660
Even if it's cold,

282
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,660
the season is changing.

283
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,660
Please be careful not to catch a cold.

284
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,660
Please be careful not to catch a cold.

285
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,660
My light.

286
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,660
It's gone again.

287
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,660
How tall are you?

288
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,660
I'm...

289
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,660
I haven't done it lately.

290
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,660
170...

291
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,660
Isn't it 70?

292
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,660
At the beginning of my debut,

293
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,660
I was 74.

294
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,660
I was 74.

295
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,660
I was 74.

296
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,660
I was 74.

297
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,660
It's not that big.

298
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,660
170...

299
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,660
Is it there?

300
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,660
Don't you know?

301
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,660
Don't you know?

302
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,660
What should I say?

303
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,660
170...

304
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,660
I don't know if it's there or not.

305
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,660
I don't know if it's there or not.

306
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,660
That much.

307
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,660
It's hard. Korean.

308
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,660
Is it possible or not?

309
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,660
170B.

310
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,660
Is it possible or not?

311
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,660
My height is 170.

312
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,660
Is it possible or not?

313
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,660
170B.

314
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,660
170B.

315
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,660
170B.

316
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,660
170B.

317
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,660
170B.

318
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,660
170B.

319
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,660
170B.

320
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,660
170B.

321
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,660
170B.

322
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,660
170B.

323
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,660
170B.

324
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,660
170B.

325
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,660
180B.

326
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,660
180B.

327
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,660
180B.

328
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,660
180B.

329
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,660
180B.

330
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,660
180B.

331
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,660
180B.

332
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,160
180B.

333
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,660
180B.

334
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,660
161B.

335
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,660
"18??"

336
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,660
ness.

337
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,660
181B.

338
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,660
18?

339
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,660
I'll try it

340
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,480
I'm really... Daehyeong baby

341
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,660
Recently, Eunchae

342
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,360
Seems to be o holding back

343
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:35,660
Did you work out today? I just came back from working out.

344
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,660
But it's been a while since I've done it, so I don't feel any strength.

345
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:45,660
It's not easy to work out.

346
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:57,660
I worked out thinking about soy sauce marinated crab.

347
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:06,660
I think I'm going to eat with the members later.

348
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:13,660
I worked out thinking about soy sauce marinated crab.

349
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:18,660
I did the hamstring thing.

350
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,660
The machine that you bend in the back.

351
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,660
I did that.

352
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:27,660
I got strength from doing soy sauce marinated crab.

353
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,660
As expected, the power of appetite.

354
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,660
I recommend you to do this.

355
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,660
Think about what you want to eat and work out.

356
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,660
That way, it works out well.

357
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,660
Uh-uh.

358
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,660
I'm sorry.

359
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,660
I'm sorry.

360
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,660
I'm sorry.

361
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,660
I'm sorry.

362
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,660
I'm sorry.

363
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,660
I'm sorry.

364
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,660
I'm sorry.

365
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,660
I'm sorry.

366
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,660
I'm sorry.

367
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,660
Uh-uh.

368
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,660
I'm sorry.

369
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,660
I'm sorry.

370
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,660
I'm sorry.

371
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,660
My MBTI is...

372
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,660
INFP.

373
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:25,660
But lately, I've felt a little bit of an issue.

374
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,660
What?

375
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,660
Uh?

376
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,660
What?

377
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,660
There are times when I feel like I'm T

378
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,660
But I told that to Yunjin unnie

379
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,660
I said, I feel like I'm T these days

380
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,660
Yunjin unnie said, but Zuhua, do you know this?

381
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,660
F means I think I'm T

382
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:54,660
T means I don't think I'm F

383
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,660
So you're F

384
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,660
You said it like that

385
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,660
I see, then I'm F

386
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,660
I guess I'm F

387
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,660
I guess I'm F when I think about it

388
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,660
Jeon Mechoo? Should I say Jeon Mechoo?

389
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,660
I eat meat

390
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,660
What do you want to eat?

391
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,660
For me...

392
00:21:35,225 --> 00:21:37,269


393
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,660
In Busan, Daegu

394
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:51,660
I ate makjang and daechang

395
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,660
It was so good

396
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,660
Originally

397
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,660
I really liked daechang

398
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,660
Makjang and

399
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,660
I said daechang

400
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,660
Not daechang

401
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,660
Makjang and

402
00:22:06,404 --> 00:22:07,879


403
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,660
What's makchang?

404
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,660
Makchang and

405
00:22:09,272 --> 00:22:11,987


406
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,660
Makchang and

407
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,660
Not that

408
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,660
Not that

409
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,660
Makchang and

410
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,506


411
00:22:17,573 --> 00:22:19,898


412
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,660
What's makchang?

413
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,660
Tell me

414
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,486


415
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,660
Makchang

416
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,660
Right, right

417
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,660
There's makchang

418
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,660
There's daechang

419
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,660
In Daegu

420
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,660
Gopchang, makchang, daechang

421
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,660
Right

422
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,660
I ate Gopchang and makchang

423
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,660
It was really good

424
00:22:30,939 --> 00:22:32,954


425
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,660
It was really good

426
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,660
It was better when I ate it at the store

427
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,660
To Fiona

428
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,660
Today

429
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,660
I recommend Gopchang

430
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,660
You should try it

431
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,660
It's more такихank

432
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,660
As you can see

433
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,660
It's actually

434
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,660
're cooked

435
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,660
It's good

436
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,660
It's really good

437
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,660
It's good

438
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,660
This is

439
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,660
Gopchang

440
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,660
With the black pepper

441
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,660
마음에

442
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,660
I see

443
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,880
Cranberries

444
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,660
Black pepper

445
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,660
This part is

446
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,660
Cha eh

447
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,660
Yeah

448
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,660
Yeah

449
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,600
You can

450
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,660
Eat it

451
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,660
in the smell

452
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,660
Cha eh

453
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,660
I wanted to go

454
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,660
of...

455
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,660
Oh

456
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,660
I really wanted to do that

457
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,660
Did you enjoy Zimline?

458
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:39,493


459
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,660
It's still a secret

460
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,660
Really?

461
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,930


462
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,660
We know everything

463
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,660
We know everything

464
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,660
Really

465
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,660
Capture time

466
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,660
Capture time

467
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:34,660
I don't know any poses these days, but what do you think?

468
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,660
Make a heart

469
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:40,660
Click

470
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,660
Protein smile

471
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:48,660
Ribbon heart

472
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:56,660
The person who thought of the ribbon heart is amazing.

473
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,660
What did you say?

474
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,660
It's just a pose even if you stay still.

475
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,660
You're cool.

476
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:08,660
Show me your cheeks.

477
00:25:09,385 --> 00:25:10,384


478
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,660
Happy birthday.

479
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:24,660
I'm happier than I was before

480
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,660
Where have all the cheeks gone?

481
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:32,660
Belarus

482
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,660
I came to play with P extract points for a while

483
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:42,660
It took me 25 minutes to do it

484
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,660
It's really fast!

485
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,660
I'll be right there

486
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,660
My legs hurt excitedly.

487
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:52,660
Oh, it's coming out. It's really fast.

488
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:57,660
Something comes out at 5 o'clock.

489
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:02,660
I don't think it's going to be a big one.

490
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,878


491
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,660
I'll go now.

492
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:17,660
Is it big enough?

493
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,660
I'm sure there's something big enough.

494
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,660
Thank you for coming at this time.

495
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,660
See you again.

496
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,660
From tomorrow.

497
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,660
No.

498
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,660
Eat something delicious for dinner.

499
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,660
Bye. I'll have something delicious, too.

500
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:43,110


501
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,660
Bye bye.

502
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,660
I'll be back.
