1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,920
Kind Ye act

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,660
I want to see

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,060
so many songs

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,680
Ye ye ye ye ye

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,520
You're on my way

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,880
Hello

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,900
It's me

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,900
How are you, how are you

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to go to bed.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Come on in.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Come on in.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll turn on the song.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What should I play?

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
How do I do this?

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Wait

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This is not my ID

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll change it to my ID

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hello

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Siwoo is so cute

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So cute

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
As soon as I saw the shoes

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I was shocked because they were so cute

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Crocs are this small

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So Siwoo can wear them

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What was the password?

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I did it

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Okay

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What is this face?

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Please do this face

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What is this face?

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't know

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Is it 3 a.m. in America?

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh my god

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
3 a.m.?

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Isn't it too late?

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Just do it

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Okay

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll do it

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What song should I dance to?

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll dance to my favorite song

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
All right

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
All right

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Here we go

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
There's so much left to say

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I guess I'm just a little bit by bit

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm just a bit by bit

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm just a bit by bit

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm just a bit by bit

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm just a bit by bit

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm just a bit by bit

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:41,000
LUNIVERSE will be released at 8pm, so I'll turn it off before that because I have to focus on LUNIVERSE.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's not black hair. I just toned it down, but it looks like black hair.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's a little bit like an old-fashioned color.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
My hair doesn't tie. Look at this.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What should I do? When will it grow?

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Are you here because you're bored again today?

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yes, that's right.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Thank you.

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Wait a minute. I want to tie my hair, but my hair doesn't come out like this.

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll force you to tie it up.

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The first

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'll cut the wood.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Do you want to die?

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
How do you cut it?

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
How do you cut it?

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Like this?

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You know what a summer rock is, right?

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh, but because of this.

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
When you tie it up like this,

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You know that taste, right?

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You know that taste, right?

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You know that taste, right?

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You know that taste, right?

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
hatred

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Do you know what it is?

76
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,000
I like it.

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll do it like this.

78
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,000
Eat a job

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This is my favorite jelly lately.

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's crazy. This is so delicious.

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Do I have to cover it?

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This came out because I looked at it more than yuktae image.

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
This is how I feel.

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Sherring

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,300
Go

86
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,000
Yes yes yes yes yes

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's a live video, so there's a clapping sound.

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Can you hear the piano?

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Hello.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
This is really good.

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
There's a more delicious jelly left after the lizard jelly.

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's really good.

93
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's really good.

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's really good.

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's really good.

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
There's a more delicious jelly left.

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Is it perfect?

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I've got a good feeling now.

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I feel good.

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I feel good.

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's not perfect.

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
My clothes are...

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I just did this.

104
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The time has come to wear clothes, everyone.

105
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The time has come to wear clothes, everyone.

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I have to wear this.

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I bought this jacket for this autumn.

108
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I bought this jacket for this autumn.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I bought this jacket for this autumn.

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
How is it? Isn't it pretty?

111
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Like this

112
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I can't see my face

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
My posture

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
My posture

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
was my effort

116
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I wanted to show it to you

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I wanted to show it to you

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The person who plays the song

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
is not playing the song

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
If you suddenly introduce the clothes

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What are you going to do?

122
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Seyeon

123
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm not going to play the dance

124
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I can play the dance

125
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's not fun

126
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Funny

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
similar to reality

128
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm going to comb my hair

129
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
My hair is short

130
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm going to comb my front hair

131
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm going to comb my front hair

132
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
OMG

133
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Half dough

134
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
If you freeze it, it's more delicious.

135
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What are you doing?

136
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
This jelly?

137
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This?

138
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You're going to freeze it?

139
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Then how do you chew it?

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What kind of schedule did you have today?

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Today...

142
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm filming right now.

143
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I can't tell you.

144
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm filming right now.

145
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You know I can't tell you.

146
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You know I can't tell you.

147
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Just take a pretty picture.

148
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Just take a pretty picture.

149
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Just take a pretty picture.

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It ended too early than I thought.

151
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It ended too early than I thought.

152
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's been a while since I've done this.

153
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's been a while since I've done this.

154
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I see.

155
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I thought it would end so soon.

156
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's over a lot earlier than expected.

157
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I was very happy.

158
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So, uh, it's over early.

159
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And right away.

160
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I said, paradox live.

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I was really happy.

162
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What's wrong?

163
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
This is the first time I've seen this kind of music video in a long time, so I'm looking forward to it.

164
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm looking forward to it.

165
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm looking forward to it.

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm looking forward to it.

167
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm looking forward to it.

168
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,500
I'm looking forward to it.

169
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Just fall into the trap!

170
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Just fall into the trap!

171
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,600
These can be normal?

172
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,720
This shouldn't be possible.

173
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So I'm ready to journey again

174
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,200
It's okay now

175
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,400
Really? I can't believe it's breaking

176
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,800
No way

177
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,100
Sing a band song

178
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,600
I really like band songs

179
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,400
Don't you think you know what I mean?

180
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,600
When I recommend a song

181
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,900
I recommend that kind of song a lot

182
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,900
I really like that kind of song

183
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,900
I want to try it one day

184
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,900
But it's breaking?

185
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,400
Oh my

186
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,900
Why is it breaking? Is it because it's in the basement?

187
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,900
Do I get a song request? Yes, I do

188
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,900
I totally get it

189
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,900
Give me a beer

190
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,900
It's really me

I'm really hungry

193
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,900
Let's think together

194
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,900
What should we eat for dinner?

195
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,900
Next song

196
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,900
It's really me

197
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,900
What should we eat for dinner?

00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,900
We are fine

00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:58,900

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,660
I don't have time for this.

208
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,260
It's always been my plan.

209
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,900
I don't have time for this.

210
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,900
I don't have time for this.

211
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,260

00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,240
Let the dogs up, play something by Beyoncé

233
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,320
I'm not tryna leave until they kick us to the road

I like to kick everybody

237
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,560
Where the heck is that?

238
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,400
She's waiting down in the lobby

239
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,360
I'm tryna break it down, yeah baby

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,660

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,160
But I've never been to a party

00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,280
I like to kiss everybody

244
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:29,540
Actually, I hate kissing people

245
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,320

256
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,200
I don't know how to tie this up.

257
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,660
I know what this is.

258
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,740
If you tie this up, will you be saved like this?

259
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,660
Lifted up the top, I play something by Beyonce

260
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,820
I'm not tryna leave until they kick us to the road

261

I like to dance when I party

263

Why are you crying when you're at the academy?

00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,100
It's good but sad

286
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,100
Sorry

287
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,100
The timing wasn't right

288
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,100
Why are you crying when you're at the academy?

289
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,100
Why are you crying when you're at the academy?

290
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,100
What's in the bag?

291
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,100
I don't have anything in my bag

292
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,100
I really don't have anything in my bag today

293
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,100

Okay

295
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:17,600
I can still feel the fire of that dirty old town and it burns

296
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,600
The title of the song is I Left My Heart

297
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,600
She's waiting for me cause she knows that we need each other

298
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,600
I know we feel like we're left in a hurry

299
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,600
But that's just how she told me goodbyes

300
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,600
No doubt we will create what she's waiting for me

301
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,600
And I wish I could be there tonight

302
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:52,600
Oh, I wish I could be there tonight

303
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,600
I miss the faces and I watch the stories

304
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,600
From strangers that feel just like home

305
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,600
I use the same old one-liners he taught me

306
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
While dreaming of the future

307
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,600
Drinking until the bar is closed

308
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,600
But now when I go home I'm sleeping

309
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,600
I miss the faces and I watch the stories

310
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,600
From strangers that feel just like home

311
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,600
I miss the faces and I watch the stories

312
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,600
While dreaming of the future

313
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,600
I miss the faces and I watch the stories

314
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,600
While dreaming of the future

She's so nice

329
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
There's only 3 minutes left

330
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
3 minutes?

331
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,600
3 minutes?

332
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
No way

333
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,600
That's how fast it is, everyone

334
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,600
I'm pretty right now

335
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,600
I'm pretty right now

336
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Right now

337
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,600
I want to do it for a long time

338
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Live

339
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,600
Really

340
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,600
I think it's the last song

341
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,600
I think it's the last song

342
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,600
I found something good

343
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
I found something good

344
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,600
I found something good

It's been a while since I've seen the end of the world.

360
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,600
It was a very different day from yesterday.

361
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,600
The color and smell of the wind.

362
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,600
I don't know.

363
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,600

I don't know.

368
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,600
Oh, right.

369
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,600
I don't know why I brought my shoes to the basement.

370
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,600
I don't know why I brought my shoes to the basement.

371
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,600
I don't know.

372
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,600

00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
Oh, I can't speak.

379
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,600
It was fun.

380
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,600
It was fun.

381
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,600
It was fun.

382
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,600
It was so hot at that time.

383
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,600
I went there when it was really hot.

384
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,600
One minute left.

385
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,600
One minute left.

386
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,600
One minute left.

387
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
Taeyeon, it's about time.

388
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,600
Taeyeon, it's about time.

389
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,600
I can't believe it.

390
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,600
I can't believe it.

391
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,600
Look at the mini version now.

392
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Look at the mini version now.

393
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,600
I'll leave.

394
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,600
I'll leave.

395
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Bye.

396
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,600
Yay!

398
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,600
