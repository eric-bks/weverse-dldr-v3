WEBVTT

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.520
I'm really fussy right now

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.960
I went to the dermatologist

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.640
I made a little mistake here

00:00:23.075 --> 00:00:24.560
Isn't it too red there?

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.515
No, the reason I turned on this live is

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.710
Just wait a minute

00:00:37.488 --> 00:00:38.674
It's so annoying

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.480
no

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.365
Why did I turn on the live?

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.545
Kazuha when I went to the dermatologist

00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:10.511
I went to the event you were at, right?

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.586
So I went to the dermatologist and came back.

00:01:13.586 --> 00:01:14.855
After the event

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.680
We were supposed to have dinner together

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.480
She said She didn't want to eat it

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.226
Zha wash?

00:01:23.301 --> 00:01:24.335
Yeah, why?

00:01:24.535 --> 00:01:27.560
Okay, no, I'm on a live stream

00:01:27.928 --> 00:01:29.680
- Are you live right now? - Yeah

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.060
Do you want to say hello with your voice?

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.415
- Weverse? - Yeah.

00:01:33.415 --> 00:01:34.801
Do you want to say hello with your voice?

00:01:35.062 --> 00:01:36.633
It's okay for me to go out

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.917
Can I go out now?

00:01:38.917 --> 00:01:39.853
Do you want to go out?

00:01:39.853 --> 00:01:41.069
The condition is okay

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.925
Just wait a minute

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.825
Let's tidy up the room a bit

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.975
Are you live?

00:01:53.451 --> 00:01:54.880
- Yeah - Can you hear everything?

00:01:55.378 --> 00:01:56.685
- Can you hear everything? - Yeah.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.905
I don't know if you can hear my voice.

00:01:59.072 --> 00:01:59.854
Want to come?

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.565
I just had new carpet installed

00:02:03.565 --> 00:02:04.503
You can come in

00:02:04.728 --> 00:02:06.180
- Can I come in? - Yeah.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.905
Where is the camera? I'm scared.

00:02:07.905 --> 00:02:08.897
I have it

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.480
Come and say hello

00:02:17.795 --> 00:02:19.994
- It's really funny. - No, the reason I turned it on is

00:02:19.994 --> 00:02:22.685
She said She won't eat

00:02:22.685 --> 00:02:24.833
I said I would eat alone

00:02:24.833 --> 00:02:26.843
She came as soon as She got off work

00:02:26.843 --> 00:02:28.656
"Sister, did you order meat?"

00:02:29.455 --> 00:02:31.631
"No, I didn't order it because you said you wouldn't eat it."

00:02:31.631 --> 00:02:33.880
- "Sister, do you want to eat together?" - "Do you want to eat together?"

00:02:34.675 --> 00:02:35.805
- So - That's right.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.885
While I was washing this

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.664
I'm going to turn on the live now

00:02:40.664 --> 00:02:41.808
you're right

00:02:42.093 --> 00:02:43.354
- Yes, yes - It's fun.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.020
It's new

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.505
be new

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:48.868
I never thought you'd turn on the live

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:49.724
therefore

00:02:49.882 --> 00:02:52.801
I just wanted to tell you this funny story

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.610
"Heart, you were so pretty today"

00:02:55.656 --> 00:02:57.180
- Really? - "I posted it on Twitter"

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.982
- Right - That was me, guys.

00:02:58.982 --> 00:03:00.219
I knew it right away

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:00.934
yes

00:03:00.934 --> 00:03:04.106
- Doesn't it sound like me just by looking at the way you speak? - I said it was Yunjin unnie.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.240
Fearnot, you came

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.313
that's right

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:09.125
thank you

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.970
"You were pretty, a total fall girl"

00:03:12.031 --> 00:03:13.245
It's summer

00:03:13.245 --> 00:03:14.650
- She was an autumn woman. - Today is the day.

00:03:14.725 --> 00:03:16.520
No fall

00:03:17.304 --> 00:03:18.729
I will do Autumn.

00:03:18.852 --> 00:03:19.874
Autumn

00:03:19.874 --> 00:03:21.267
- Autumn - Let's do Autumn

00:03:21.664 --> 00:03:23.943
- Autumn girl - Personal color of clothes

00:03:23.943 --> 00:03:25.414
It was brown today

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.604
- Completely - All

00:03:26.604 --> 00:03:28.539
- It was almost all brown. - It was all brown.

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:30.387
Even the lenses are brown

00:03:30.387 --> 00:03:31.488
That's right, that's right

00:03:34.711 --> 00:03:35.796
Your room is nice

00:03:35.902 --> 00:03:36.626
thank you

00:03:36.626 --> 00:03:39.529
No, your room is the prettiest

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:41.440
- No - I'm a little bit now

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.889
- It's very shabby - The room feels a bit spacious

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:46.010
- A little wide - a little

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.286
- I'm really out of it. - What should I say?

00:03:47.286 --> 00:03:49.503
It feels like there's a garden.

00:03:49.681 --> 00:03:51.705
- Garden, that's right - and

00:03:51.705 --> 00:03:53.224
Here's the solution

00:03:53.443 --> 00:03:54.844
Yes, you see, guys?

00:03:54.844 --> 00:03:56.979
- There is a solution - There is a solution

00:03:57.225 --> 00:03:58.089
A little something

00:03:58.089 --> 00:04:00.406
- There's a jellyfish over there. - It looks like the wind is blowing.

00:04:00.827 --> 00:04:02.554
There's a jellyfish over there

00:04:02.554 --> 00:04:04.325
- I can't see it because of the TV - Slowly

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.225
It feels like the wind is blowing

00:04:07.505 --> 00:04:10.072
Is that guy there again?

00:04:10.852 --> 00:04:11.892
Is it Thai food?

00:04:12.045 --> 00:04:13.680
- Right - Ordering Thai food again

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.728
- Right - So

00:04:14.728 --> 00:04:16.293
- I did it again today - because I wanted to eat Thai food

00:04:16.293 --> 00:04:17.131
I guess I'll work hard

00:04:17.131 --> 00:04:19.246
- Since you came from work - I was going to hold it in

00:04:19.381 --> 00:04:20.795
I wanted to eat something delicious

00:04:20.795 --> 00:04:22.385
- Let's eat something delicious. - Then let's eat together.

00:04:22.385 --> 00:04:23.558
- Yes, that's right. - Let's eat together.

00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:24.969
I knew it

00:04:25.475 --> 00:04:28.225
So this title is "I knew it"

00:04:28.225 --> 00:04:29.187
really?

00:04:29.683 --> 00:04:31.657
- That far? - Hey Kazuha, I knew it.

00:04:32.015 --> 00:04:32.818
No

00:04:35.206 --> 00:04:36.781
I knew it, Kazuha

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.950
Yes

00:04:38.983 --> 00:04:39.791
- Yes - Then

00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:40.802
- Hurry up and wash up. - I

00:04:40.802 --> 00:04:41.607
I'll go wash up and come back.

00:04:41.607 --> 00:04:43.389
I'm going to play with Fearnot for a bit.

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:44.821
Would you like me to make a playlist for you?

00:04:45.202 --> 00:04:45.937
Playlist

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.990
Yeah you can hear it here

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.137
I don't think I can hear you

00:04:49.936 --> 00:04:51.108
- Anyway - Goodbye

00:04:51.108 --> 00:04:52.185
See you later

00:04:54.305 --> 00:04:55.905
There's also this cute friend

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.125
Finally went

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.640
joke

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.700
This is so funny

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.880
For covering up acne

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.520
Isn't it cute?

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:11.865
Aren't you jealous?

00:05:12.144 --> 00:05:13.128
It's a blur

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.300
cute

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.410
"You like it" is correct

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.540
It's Heurimong, everyone

00:05:19.965 --> 00:05:20.965
Isn't it so cute?

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.700
So cute

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:27.960
Is it like a beard?

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.640
that's right

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.900
What did you do today, Fearnot?

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.960
"Grandpa Chicken Mustache"?

00:05:57.225 --> 00:05:58.470
Have you eaten dinner?

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.716
I just told a funny story

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.655
I was just going to eat salad by myself

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.840
Kazuha asked me to eat with her

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.000
I originally planned to eat it too

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.408
Because She said She wouldn't eat it

00:06:17.408 --> 00:06:19.869
I said okay and ordered something to eat by myself.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.640
As soon as I get off work

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.028
"Sister, did you order meat?"

00:06:23.028 --> 00:06:24.665
She said She wanted to eat meat.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.700
"No, I didn't order it" She said.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.205
This is so funny right now

00:06:30.787 --> 00:06:34.240
No, Kazuha-ssi went to wash up now.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.300
The shower room is right in front of my room.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.540
You are playing my song

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.365
I know you can't hear me very well, but

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:47.619
I went to introduce myself

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:49.908
Because you choose your own songs well

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.325
I'll put on a playlist for you

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.240
You are playing my song

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.580
It's so funny

00:07:29.735 --> 00:07:30.600
Can you hear me?

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.965
You might not hear it

00:07:42.965 --> 00:07:43.990
I can hear you

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:53.420
Can't you hear me?

00:07:54.525 --> 00:07:57.630
But I heard

00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:07.560
Covering acne with a beard

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.680
Do you know what it is?

00:08:12.775 --> 00:08:14.220
Are you cute, Heurimong?

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.950
Isn't it cute?

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.175
It's all blue

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:37.420
Up to this point

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.080
How about a room introduction?

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.580
Room introduction

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.720
A little room

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.700
It's a little messy

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:57.820
Is it okay to show this much?

00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.705
wait for a sec

00:08:59.933 --> 00:09:01.500
I'm so worried

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.605
The room

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.500
Room tour?

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.240
First, I'll show you this.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:20.940
Isn't it cute?

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:26.240
So cute

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.985
This looks really pretty when you turn off the lights.

00:09:39.035 --> 00:09:40.360
Can you hear me?

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.190
So funny

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.480
I heard it well, Mr. Zha

00:10:02.205 --> 00:10:03.140
Isn't it pretty?

00:10:12.006 --> 00:10:12.849
Isn't it pretty?

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.000
And I showed you last time

00:10:17.805 --> 00:10:18.815
glasses

00:10:19.945 --> 00:10:25.200
And this is when I recently went to Japan

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.530
At the fan touch event

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.440
I stole what was left

00:10:39.415 --> 00:10:40.140
Good, right?

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.300
Good

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.340
Really

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:48.820
Isn't it too dark?

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.980
Then I'll turn on the lights.

00:11:10.705 --> 00:11:12.340
It's been a while since I've seen a dark room

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.760
How did the name Heurimong come about?

00:11:19.949 --> 00:11:21.689
"How was Heurimong made?"

00:11:21.689 --> 00:11:25.047
"Did you create the name and visual?"

00:11:25.047 --> 00:11:25.963
That's right.

00:11:26.212 --> 00:11:29.110
In last year's episode of "Leniverse"

00:11:29.717 --> 00:11:31.494
We created the designs.

00:11:31.494 --> 00:11:32.756
At that time

00:11:33.825 --> 00:11:38.256
This little kid's name was Puhu.

00:11:39.343 --> 00:11:41.347
Like a ghost bu

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:44.703
I'm going to talk about it later because my last name is Heo.

00:11:45.785 --> 00:11:46.820
Phew

00:11:50.177 --> 00:11:51.783
FIM's CLUB

00:11:53.098 --> 00:11:56.200
I think it's because of the brand.

00:11:56.757 --> 00:11:58.718
So I changed my name.

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.906
I like Heurimong too

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.740
Heurimong...

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.340
Heurimong...

00:12:06.005 --> 00:12:09.449
Blurry... It comes from the word "blurry"

00:12:11.386 --> 00:12:13.333
That's what it means

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:14.900
That's...

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:29.260
Now you're playing 'Yes or No' again

00:12:36.122 --> 00:12:36.959
So funny

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.560
♪ Apartment Apartment

00:12:39.615 --> 00:12:41.053
♪ Apartment Apartment

00:12:41.183 --> 00:12:42.615
♪ Apartment Apartment

00:12:42.615 --> 00:12:44.359
♪ Uh, uh huh uh huh

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:49.585
Do you want to live in Heurimong?

00:12:49.585 --> 00:12:51.488
Heurimong is really cute

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:54.676
No, this one strand of hair

00:12:54.676 --> 00:12:57.700
Because I can decorate it so beautifully

00:13:00.481 --> 00:13:01.551
It's cute

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:03.740
Isn't it so cute?

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.240
Are you looking to buy a new perfume?

00:13:11.065 --> 00:13:13.220
I like the perfume I'm using now.

00:13:15.935 --> 00:13:19.060
Sister Chaewon hasn't finished work yet

00:13:21.545 --> 00:13:23.040
"Introducing perfume"?

00:13:24.805 --> 00:13:25.940
"Introducing perfume"?

00:13:27.275 --> 00:13:28.745
It's too far

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:30.810
It's too far

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:31.707
but

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.445
Well, I'll just tell you the most used ones these days.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.440
Deep*k's

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:48.590
What's your name?

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:49.409
that...

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.480
You know, that fig-scented thing

00:14:11.425 --> 00:14:12.920
Philosykos is right

00:14:13.979 --> 00:14:16.092
"Why did the chicken cross the road?"

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.820
I don't know

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.659
"It looks like you're carrying a fig"?

00:14:24.659 --> 00:14:25.977
I am so good

00:14:27.445 --> 00:14:28.870
Philosykos is right

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.366
Right, coffee, coffee

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:37.960
"It's laggy"?

00:14:48.453 --> 00:14:51.214
"Heurimong, can you express your emotions with your head?"

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.975
It's a heart

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.575
While playing 'Raise y_our glass'

00:15:16.575 --> 00:15:17.680
I just passed by

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:19.440
I guess you washed it all up

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.520
okay

00:15:21.035 --> 00:15:22.200
Well then, I'll stop here

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.160
It was fun, even if it was short, Fearnot

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.100
I love you

00:15:29.785 --> 00:15:33.005
I'll upload a picture of our dinner

00:15:34.115 --> 00:15:35.160
I love you

00:15:35.615 --> 00:15:37.720
I really appreciate your sense in song selection

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.180
Bye i love you

00:15:40.363 --> 00:15:41.148
Good night

00:15:41.148 --> 00:15:43.155
If you haven't had dinner yet, even though you're awake

00:15:43.155 --> 00:15:44.666
Please eat it quickly

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.040
