1
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,900
Hello.

2
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:21,733
Hello, hello, hello.

3
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,300
I brought this bread.

4
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,233
I know.

5
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,233
I'm doing it now.

6
00:00:58,633 --> 00:00:59,643
I'm doing it. I haven't
been on the show for

7
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:01,347
a long time, so I want
to be on it one day.

8
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:06,300
I've never been on a roller coaster,
so I want to go out one day.

9
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:12,067
I'm eating salt bread.

10
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:14,933
I'm going to eat salt bread.

11
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:33,133
I haven't been live for a long time.

12
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:39,567
When was it?
During the promotion.

13
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,800
Last time I
did it for a short time.

14
00:01:54,933 --> 00:01:55,867
Where did it go?

15
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:58,767
Someone said it was fun at
the fan signing event yesterday.

16
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:06,633
Thank you for coming to
the fan signing event today.

17
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:17,667
What should I talk about?

18
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:27,967
After the fan signing
event today... And...

19
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:31,167
I was shooting the content.

20
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,333
Why the practice room? Is it a concert?

21
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,833
I think you should wait a
little longer for the concert.

22
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:46,633
You have to have a lot of
songs to make it really different.

23
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,833
So...

24
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,133
I asked a lot of questions today.

25
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,400
Even at the fan signing event.

26
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,300
Wait a little longer.

27
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:58,327
I'll just wait.
Let's have a year-end performance.

28
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:00,300
Do it well.

29
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:04,867
Earlier... At the Han River...
They did a fireworks

30
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:05,974
They did a fireworks show?

31
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:09,767
Fireworks?
It wasn't a party.

32
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:10,909
It wasn't that much of a size.

33
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:15,300
Is it a firework festival?

34
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,500
So I went up to the rooftop.

35
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:22,033
I went to see it with my managers.

36
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,933
Yes, it's really amazing.

37
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,100
Really?

38
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,100
It's been a long time since I
saw the fireworks properly.

39
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:39,167
Ever since I was a student...

40
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,801
Ever since I was a student, I used to
see them a lot when I was in my teens.

41
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:47,333
But for me...

42
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:53,867
When I have summer break, I
go to see them with my family.

43
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:58,167
I saw them a lot when I was an idol.

44
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,633
Did you cry?

45
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,733
Wow, there's someone
who knows me from the past.

46
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,700
I didn't cry, but the
sound was really loud.

47
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:10,733
So I was a little scared.

48
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,700
But other than that, it was
okay. They were so pretty.

49
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:16,066
It's like...

50
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,700
I'm not the type of person
who just thinks they're pretty.

51
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:22,867
It's like...

52
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:30,000
I was wondering how many people
in Korea are watching these fireworks.

53
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:32,867
When I see these fireworks next year,

54
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:37,567
I was wondering what
kind of person I would be.

55
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,033
It was pretty, right?

56
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:47,133
There was a fireworks
competition at the Han River.

57
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:51,633
All the managers were watching it.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,033
Oh, that's right.

59
00:04:55,833 --> 00:05:00,500
I was told a lot about where I
went for the punishment game.

60
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:03,133
For now...

61
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:07,833
I can't do it in front of people
who don't know the flow.

62
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,500
I decided to do it at Weverse Live.

63
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:13,033
I'll do it someday.

64
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:18,167
I had a pack. I have to do it in Portugal.

65
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:19,834
But no matter how much I think about it,

66
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,933
I don't know the flow.

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,400
There are other fans.

68
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:25,600
It's not easy to do it.

69
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:27,900
I don't have the courage to do it.

70
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:29,243
I don't get the courage to do it.

71
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:31,133
Still, I had a schedule.

72
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
I had a schedule.

73
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:34,633
When I went to work, I
already had makeup on me.

74
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,733
This is what happened.

75
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,243
Unfortunately, I can't go to work.

76
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:43,033
I'll just do it someday at Weverse Live.

77
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,900
Please understand.

78
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:49,500
And I want to see pretty faces.

79
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:51,400
On the way to work.

80
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,999
So.

81
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:04,633
Compared to the other members,
it wasn't easy for me and Eunchae

82
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,033
I'll do it next time

83
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:14,867
Have you seen all the fireworks?

84
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:16,732
Pretty

85
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:25,500
I ate the soup, the
clam chowder? I ate it.

86
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:33,633
Long time no see.

87
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,967
I just ate it simply and ate it
properly after I got off work.

88
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,533
I ate it simply.

89
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:47,067
Can I play something I want to listen to?

90
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:23,133
Sabrina Carpenter did a live.

91
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:26,400
Seriously, so pretty.

92
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:30,733
Did you see that, everyone?

93
00:07:31,733 --> 00:07:33,733
I think some people don't know.

94
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,400
Like this.

95
00:07:37,467 --> 00:07:38,467
Wait.

96
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:43,200
I want to explain it properly. At this
Sabrina concert,

97
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:46,667
At first, it was a little...

98
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,533
It was a little late concept.

99
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:52,567
So I was covering my clothes like this.

100
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:53,800
I know, I know.

101
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:55,867
Does anyone know?

102
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:58,100
I came like this.

103
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,433
Show it like this.

104
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,567
I was so scared.

105
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:04,027
And then I looked at it like this.

106
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,067
The microphone didn't come out.

107
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:11,733
I'm doing this.

108
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:18,933
All the movements are so lovely.

109
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,200
How can it be so lovely?

110
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:24,233
But when I'm watching, it's so cute.

111
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,299
That's it.

112
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,900
Tiktok...

113
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:27,966
These days...

114
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,301
There was someone who did the challenge.

115
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,332
I should do it later.

116
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:44,333
This song is really...

117
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,367
We got a vacation this time, right?

118
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:49,633
At that time in Hawaii...

119
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,767
I went to Hawaii with my family.

120
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,367
But I went to the beach at night.

121
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,600
The beach is right in front of the hotel.

122
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:03,400
There's a place where you can lie down.

123
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:08,833
I was listening to this
song while lying down there.

124
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:25,600
I think the lyrics of
Sabrina's song are so cute.

125
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:29,900
It's like a lovely...

126
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:32,600
Feeling annoying?

127
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:35,167
I like it.

128
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:39,000
It's cute.

129
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:41,933
I can't hate it.

130
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:47,800
I was listening to this song
when I was on vacation in Hawaii.

131
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:57,367
I don't feel like I burned my hands.

132
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:59,633
My hands are burning.

133
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,633
I didn't burn my hands
a lot in other places.

134
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,633
I burned a little, but
my hands are burning.

135
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:09,633
My hands are burning.

136
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,700
I don't know why.

137
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,900
It's good that I don't eat.
It's good.

138
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:20,633
I want to go to the concert.

139
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,633
This Sabrina's set is so cute.

140
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,933
It was so nice to sing
while sitting at the heart.

141
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,700
It was good.

142
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,300
We went to VMA.

143
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,633
We went to VMA.

144
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,367
The set was... There
were two stages.

145
00:10:47,467 --> 00:10:48,567
Really, here...

146
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:51,300
There are two stages.
But if you do it this way...

147
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:53,467
It leads this way...

148
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:54,876
Suddenly something really different...

149
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,233
It's a house

150
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,333
The set was amazing.

151
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,667
It was amazing.

152
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:08,933
It was like watching a musical.

153
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:11,733
It was amazing.

154
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,000
It was VMA.

155
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:17,367
It wasn't our stage.

156
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:20,000
It was the stage at the awards ceremony.

157
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:22,367
The stage we were watching.

158
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:24,433
It was amazing.

159
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,409
I'm wearing it because I
want to talk about vacation.

160
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:30,700
Shall we talk about vacation?

161
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:33,367
We got vacation for the first time.

162
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:34,567
So...

163
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:36,132
It's like...

164
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:39,067
It's kind of...

165
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,467
Since I was young, There's
something about Japanese.

166
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:47,267
If you say
vacation, It's Hawaii.

167
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,367
It's a must.

168
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:49,367
There's something like that.

169
00:11:49,433 --> 00:11:50,367
Something like that.

170
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:53,567
So I... There's
something like that.

171
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:57,100
Celebrities go to Hawaii on vacation.

172
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:58,200
Something like that.

173
00:11:58,267 --> 00:12:01,400
Since I was in elementary school,

174
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:02,400
Ever since I was a student,

175
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:03,400
There was something like that.

176
00:12:03,467 --> 00:12:04,400
The atmosphere was like that.

177
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:06,400
So I have to go on vacation there.

178
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:09,400
When I heard that
a vacation was coming this time,

179
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:11,633
I have to go to Hawaii.

180
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,400
I called my mom right away.

181
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:16,000
So... Mom, I have
to go to Hawaii.

182
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:18,567
I've never been there.

183
00:12:18,633 --> 00:12:20,333
This vacation is in Hawaii.

184
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
So...

185
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:23,133
I went.

186
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,767
I'll explain in Japanese.

187
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,400
When I was told that I was
going on vacation for the first time,

188
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:33,400
Something like... Vacation?

189
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:38,600
Vacation equals... Celebrities'
vacation equals Hawaii.

190
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:39,843
It's been like that for a long time.

191
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:41,400
That kind of atmosphere.

192
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:42,867
Something like that.

193
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:45,967
It's just my imagination.

194
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,367
I've never been to Hawaii.

195
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,367
Once.

196
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:53,367
I thought I'd definitely go to
Hawaii on my first vacation.

197
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:58,433
So I went to Hawaii.

198
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,433
At first,

199
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:05,167
There was a hotel called Kahala Hotel.

200
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:10,833
There was a hotel where they
were building dolphins in the hotel.

201
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,400
But it's about 10 minutes
away from Waikiki.

202
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:16,400
There's not much people there.

203
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:18,443
From the hotel to the swimming pool.

204
00:13:18,467 --> 00:13:20,233
It's all connected to the sea.

205
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,667
Next to the swimming pool.

206
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:25,100
Are you raising a dolphin?

207
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,233
So you can just see the dolphins.

208
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,300
If you make a reservation there.

209
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:32,400
From 9 o'clock.

210
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:33,467
A little bit.

211
00:13:33,533 --> 00:13:34,532
Experience.

212
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,400
Swim with the dolphins.

213
00:13:37,467 --> 00:13:39,400
Play with the dolphins.

214
00:13:39,467 --> 00:13:42,400
There's something like that.

215
00:13:43,367 --> 00:13:45,367
So I made a reservation for that, too.

216
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:49,533
And there's a restaurant in the hotel.

217
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:55,367
It's a really famous restaurant there.

218
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:56,833
Just in Hawaii.

219
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,400
So I ate there.

220
00:14:00,467 --> 00:14:02,633
It was really good.

221
00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:06,733
So what was it?

222
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:09,167
On the first day.

223
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:11,433
I don't remember.

224
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,800
All of a sudden.
Wait a minute.

225
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:15,867
Oh, right.
On the first day.

226
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,433
This is.

227
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
It's really a little bit.

228
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,500
It's my first time.

229
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,433
Anyone can see.

230
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:29,133
I wanted to be like a
person who came to travel.

231
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Everyone is famous.

232
00:14:31,267 --> 00:14:33,267
It's like a minor.

233
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,433
It's not like a person who
lives in Hawaii is going.

234
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,433
For the first time in Hawaii.

235
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,233
Like a person.

236
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,033
I wanted to do it.

237
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,967
Famous in Japan.
From CF.

238
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:47,000
There's a really big tree.

239
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:49,433
It's called Konoki Nanoki.

240
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:52,067
I went to see that tree.

241
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,333
What did I do on the first day?

242
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:04,500
I really don't remember.
All of a sudden.

243
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:07,400
First.

244
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:10,600
I did that.
The next day.

245
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:13,567
Oh.

246
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:14,567
Snorkeling?

247
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:15,733
That.

248
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,700
I got on a yacht.

249
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:20,767
The sea.
I think it's a crab.

250
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,767
I went pretty far.

251
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,133
There.
This.

252
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,100
I'm wearing goggles.

253
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:27,067
Like this.

254
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:29,333
Watching the sea.

255
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,333
Swim with the fish.

256
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,333
And there's a turtle.

257
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,900
There's just a turtle.

258
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,333
Next to it.

259
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,800
But we can't get close.

260
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:39,143
But if you come
from there. Well.

261
00:15:39,167 --> 00:15:42,300
You can see it from a distance.

262
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:44,367
I've experienced that.

263
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:47,067
I did that.

264
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:48,132
I did a lot of things.

265
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,900
It was really fun.

266
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:55,100
I saw a turtle.

267
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:57,333
I examined a turtle.

268
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,599
That.

269
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:03,933
Surfboard.

270
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Not really surfing.

271
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:08,732
Like this.

272
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:11,767
There's something like
a canoe, and that too...

273
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:15,300
I uploaded a picture, so it
was there, but I also did that...

274
00:16:17,033 --> 00:16:18,033
Oh, that's right.

275
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,567
I'm not that good at English...

276
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,967
I went with my mom
and younger brother, right?

277
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:26,333
My dad was going to go too, but

278
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,433
he suddenly got sick and
couldn't go, so the three of us went.

279
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,933
Oh, by the way he's okay now.

280
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,067
Are you worried? Are you okay?

281
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:38,133
My dad is the best at English,

282
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,833
but he couldn't do it, so I was like,

283
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:42,900
what should I do?

284
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:49,800
I had no choice but to speak English,
so I tried my best to speak English.

285
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:59,800
When I was on the surfboard, it was
at the same time as this Korean person.

286
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:02,433
I made a reservation for the same time.

287
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:08,300
They didn't recognize me,
but I kept speaking in Korean.

288
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:11,567
They were good at English,
so I spoke in English.

289
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:15,933
The English was a bit faster back
then, so I couldn't understand it.

290
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,400
I took a picture

291
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:22,867
and there was some explanation about whether
to save it to them via USB or SD card.

292
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:25,233
It was difficult, so I
asked them in Korean,

293
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,133
But by any chance... this...

294
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,867
Just once, how do you say in English...

295
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:32,333
Can you translate
that for me? He said...

296
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,399
In Korean...

297
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,100
I switched to Korean, and
they were really surprised.

298
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:38,647
They were like, wasn't that Japanese?

299
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:43,567
I said, I'm living in Korea,
so I can speak Korean.

300
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:48,167
We could communicate in three languages.

301
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:52,600
I explained it to my mom in
Japanese, and when she replied,

302
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:55,767
I translated it to Korean.

303
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,700
Then the Koreans
translated it into English.

304
00:17:58,767 --> 00:18:01,067
There were so many languages at that time.

305
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:05,233
But I was relieved that
I could speak Korean.

306
00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:10,100
They said they just like traveling.

307
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:12,500
Recently, I went to Fukuoka.

308
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:16,367
They said, wait really?
Fukuoka is my hometown.

309
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:17,700
We talked about it.

310
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:19,700
It was fun.

311
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,200
It was amazing.

312
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,300
English...

313
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:28,433
It was really hard.

314
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,533
The most I can talk about is...

315
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,700
I was the only one there.

316
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,176
My brother said he didn't want to talk
because he was embarrassed.

317
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,767
I had no choice but to speak.

318
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,967
My younger brother also speaks English.

319
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:48,167
Well, but still?

320
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:50,700
Did you go to kindergarten
when you were young?

321
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:51,633
In terms of...

322
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,733
I went to kindergarten

323
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:55,900
Did you?

324
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:59,067
And you're learning this in school
now, if you're a middle school student.

325
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:01,733
So, I had no choice but to do it.

326
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,733
He kept saying it's embarrassing...

327
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,900
I had no choice but to do it.

328
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:09,933
But it's understandable.

329
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:14,307
And you saw all the pictures, right?

330
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:19,633
It's almost all my brother's pictures.

331
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,333
My mom is really bad at taking pictures.

332
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,133
Really.

333
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,033
Seriously, seriously.

334
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,267
There's nothing you can do about it.
There are things that people are good at.

335
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,332
That's true.

336
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:31,733
But it was such a pretty scene.

337
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,833
No, like this landscape was so pretty

338
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,933
like this is so real I
need to take a picture...

339
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
It's really cool.

340
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:42,232
Really.

341
00:19:42,267 --> 00:19:44,733
So I told my mom.

342
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800
Please.

343
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:50,333
Like this, I said, Mom, try it.

344
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
I set the angle.

345
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:54,500
Mom, mom, now, now.

346
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:56,467
You know this angle, right?

347
00:19:56,533 --> 00:19:57,867
But my mom moved it.

348
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,267
Yeah... right now...

349
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,332
well...

350
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,900
I was going to tell you...

351
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:04,767
I guess there are some difficulties.

352
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,800
My younger brother was
watching it from the side. So...

353
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:09,767
But...

354
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,500
Let my little brother take the picture.

355
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:17,133
He was right next to me, so he
was listening to what I was saying.

356
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,367
He understood everything... so...

357
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:22,800
So, my brother took a picture of me.

358
00:20:22,867 --> 00:20:24,267
But the funny thing is that...

359
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,033
I uploaded it on Instagram.

360
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,833
My mom called me and said,

361
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,367
Oh, but, I think I took such a good photo!

362
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:35,800
I said, Mom, that's my brother's picture.

363
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,767
She said, Oh, really? No?

364
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,500
I said, No, it's not.

365
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,867
She was like, Ah, I took
all these pictures, so...

366
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:45,967
I had a lot of fun.

367
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:48,933
My little brother was taking a picture of
me.

368
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,160
My brother is better at
taking pictures than I thought.

369
00:20:53,267 --> 00:20:56,333
My mom really can't take pictures.

370
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,400
It's really horrible.

371
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:00,633
It's a picture that looks like a lie.

372
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:06,033
Even if I say stay in the
middle, Is that difficult?

373
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,533
That's why my brother
kept taking pictures of me.

374
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,167
My younger brother took this photo.

375
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,600
It's been a long time since
I've talked to my brother.

376
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,167
We talk a lot.

377
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:25,300
I used to hang out with my brother often.

378
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:28,233
After my brother became a student,

379
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,700
I've never really hung out with him.

380
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:33,067
When I came to Tokyo,

381
00:21:33,133 --> 00:21:37,400
Sometimes I just looked at the picture.

382
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:39,343
It was my first time
seeing him for a long time.

383
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:41,433
We talked and it was fun.

384
00:21:53,267 --> 00:21:56,700
We're the same age.

385
00:21:59,467 --> 00:22:01,467
It's difficult.

386
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,109
He seems like he'd be
good at being a photographer.

387
00:22:08,133 --> 00:22:09,333
But...

388
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:14,433
But I was always shy about taking pictures.

389
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:19,167
Photographer, are you interested?

390
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:22,400
But about myself...

391
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:24,400
But I was embarrassed
to shoot my own picture.

392
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,400
It's fun.

393
00:22:26,467 --> 00:22:29,867
I want to try to do my hair in this style.

394
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,167
Why am I so shy?

395
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:40,167
I guess it's because of that.
But I was even more shy.

396
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:45,000
It wasn't during the middle school,
but when I was in elementary school,

397
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,933
I went to eat.

398
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,733
Moms would ask me to
help with something like this.

399
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,733
I like it.

400
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,733
So that I could greet them well.

401
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,800
But I was so bad at it.

402
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:03,367
I was so shy. I cried there.

403
00:23:03,433 --> 00:23:04,767
I was so shy.

404
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:10,300
So my mom saw that and said I was too shy.

405
00:23:10,367 --> 00:23:13,167
So I went to learn musicals.

406
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,400
That was the beginning.

407
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:18,600
So my brother...

408
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:24,767
I think he's better than me.

409
00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:29,600
It was really bad.

410
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:31,600
Now I'm not as shy anymore.

411
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,433
But it was really bad then.

412
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,433
I was like that when I was young.

413
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
It's okay.

414
00:23:39,567 --> 00:23:41,300
It's not always the same.

415
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:47,467
I realized that when I lived my life.

416
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:51,500
I was so different from
what I was when I was young.

417
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,467
Even though I was in
a different environment.

418
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:57,167
So I wasn't really worried about it.

419
00:23:57,233 --> 00:24:00,667
I was like, I'm just a person.

420
00:24:00,733 --> 00:24:03,633
That's how it is when you're young.

421
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,733
You learn as you go.

422
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,000
That's what I think.

423
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,033
When I went to Hawaii,

424
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,800
there were a lot of
people who recognized me.

425
00:24:13,867 --> 00:24:19,133
But that was... Even if I
wasn't Korean or Japanese.

426
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,800
A lot of people recognized me.

427
00:24:23,867 --> 00:24:27,833
They spoke to me in English.

428
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,800
I went to a steakhouse.
It's really famous.

429
00:24:30,867 --> 00:24:33,833
Everyone in Hawaii goes there.

430
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,833
What's the name?

431
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,200
Joyce?

432
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:37,867
Jaws?

433
00:24:37,933 --> 00:24:38,833
Jays?

434
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,667
It was a steakhouse.

435
00:24:40,733 --> 00:24:43,400
The staff there.

436
00:24:44,367 --> 00:24:47,333
They were like, Are you Sakura?

437
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,233
It was so... It was amazing.

438
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,900
My mom was watching.

439
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,367
She said that she was touched.

440
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:05,400
My daughter... Wherever
she went, she recognized me.

441
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:07,667
It's not that much.

442
00:25:07,733 --> 00:25:08,633
It's amazing.

443
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,833
But she recognized me in English.

444
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,833
She talked to me.

445
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,833
So... It was amazing.

446
00:25:16,867 --> 00:25:17,947
It was amazing for me, too.

447
00:25:18,867 --> 00:25:21,133
Where do the members want to go next?

448
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,333
Members?

449
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,467
Members... It would
be fun to go anywhere.

450
00:25:26,533 --> 00:25:30,400
Next... If I get a vacation,

451
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:34,000
I want to go to Jeju Island.
I want to go nearby.

452
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:35,233
Next time.

453
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:38,867
Or I want to go to Hawaii again.
I love Hawaii.

454
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,867
If I get a vacation
next time, I want to go...

455
00:25:42,533 --> 00:25:45,033
I want to go to a nearby place.
I want to go to Jeju Island.

456
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,867
Or I want to go to Hawaii again.

457
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:52,667
A warm place... It
feels like a vacation site.

458
00:25:52,733 --> 00:25:54,833
I don't like cold places.

459
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,133
It's a little...

460
00:25:58,167 --> 00:25:59,900
It's a lot of luggage.

461
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,800
Do you know what I mean?

462
00:26:01,867 --> 00:26:04,400
Luggage becomes like that.

463
00:26:04,467 --> 00:26:05,867
But if you go to a warm place,

464
00:26:05,933 --> 00:26:07,833
You can just take a t-shirt or a one-piece.

465
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,000
You can just take thin clothes.

466
00:26:11,067 --> 00:26:12,600
So... I like light clothes.

467
00:26:12,667 --> 00:26:16,833
It was a very T statement.

468
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,899
Right?

469
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,800
I think you know what I mean.

470
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:24,633
I'm a realistic person.

471
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,967
Because... There are a
lot of things I want to get.

472
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:31,467
If I just pack a
padded jacket, It's over.

473
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,067
I'm so sad about that.

474
00:26:46,367 --> 00:26:48,533
I wonder if it's still possible in Japan.

475
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,667
Certainly, not at all.

476
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,399
What should I do?

477
00:26:52,867 --> 00:26:53,867
You don't know, do you?

478
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:55,967
Please wait a little longer.

479
00:26:57,733 --> 00:26:58,833
Just a little bit more.

480
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:17,233
I bought this hat because it's too cute.
I want to see you wearing it.

481
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:21,067
There were a lot of
people who wore it today.

482
00:27:26,633 --> 00:27:28,933
This is a wink.

483
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:35,567
Happy birthday, Seulgi and I.
Happy birthday!

484
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,467
These days...

485
00:27:39,967 --> 00:27:41,567
Culinary Class Wars is really popular...

486
00:27:42,033 --> 00:27:44,100
Do you watch them all?

487
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:46,200
I haven't watched it yet.

488
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,967
I heard it's really fun.

489
00:27:50,033 --> 00:27:53,033
I haven't even seen the meme.

490
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,533
I only know what the members say.

491
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
I'll think about it.

492
00:27:58,467 --> 00:28:00,467
I'll think about it for a while.

493
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:02,832
What is this?

494
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:06,100
I'm going to cover my eyes and eat it.

495
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,300
I heard the explanation of what it is.

496
00:28:11,367 --> 00:28:14,867
I was going to watch it,
but I haven't seen it yet.

497
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,400
I made a lot of posters.

498
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,233
Who did you see?

499
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,233
Chaewon and Yunjin and Zuha.

500
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,467
I think so.

501
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:39,400
When we go to local events...

502
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,333
We missed Zuha.

503
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,467
Right.

504
00:28:42,533 --> 00:28:45,700
We went to the university
festival this week.

505
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,367
It was really fun.

506
00:28:47,433 --> 00:28:53,567
The university students had a lot of fun.

507
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,600
It was so much fun.

508
00:28:56,367 --> 00:29:00,000
We went to the festival as
soon as the vacation was over.

509
00:29:00,067 --> 00:29:03,100
So... Something...

510
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:06,900
It felt like we were performing
for the first time in a long time.

511
00:29:06,967 --> 00:29:08,900
I had a lot of fun.

512
00:29:09,433 --> 00:29:10,967
And...

513
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,967
We went to Busan and Daegu.

514
00:29:15,933 --> 00:29:18,867
Is it the first time for us to go?

515
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:20,533
As a schedule?

516
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,933
I went to Busan once in the past.

517
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,867
This time, On the day
we arrived in Busan,

518
00:29:30,933 --> 00:29:31,867
It was dawn.

519
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:33,933
We went to eat grilled clams.

520
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:37,067
The next day, I woke up.

521
00:29:39,133 --> 00:29:46,167
I had beoguk... beoguk?
Beoguk. Burger and soup.

522
00:29:47,067 --> 00:29:49,333
It was really good.

523
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,200
I really like it.

524
00:29:51,767 --> 00:29:53,867
Bugeoguk soup.

525
00:29:53,933 --> 00:29:54,967
Right.

526
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,700
We had a burger there.

527
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:03,900
Bugeo... And...
We had fried food.

528
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:05,900
I really like burgers.

529
00:30:05,967 --> 00:30:07,900
It's been a long time since I had it.

530
00:30:07,967 --> 00:30:08,900
I was so happy.

531
00:30:08,967 --> 00:30:10,967
After eating that,

532
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:14,900
We went to the beach.

533
00:30:14,967 --> 00:30:16,967
We saw the sea.

534
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,700
The next day, We went to Daegu.

535
00:30:19,767 --> 00:30:22,700
It was dawn.

536
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:24,900
We had to eat something delicious.

537
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:27,900
So, We had makjang (pork offal).

538
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:30,007
It was the first time I had
makjang at a restaurant.

539
00:30:30,633 --> 00:30:32,633
It was really delicious.

540
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,800
It was a little serious.

541
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:35,100
It was so delicious.

542
00:30:36,233 --> 00:30:38,633
Does it taste the same
when you eat it in Daegu?

543
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,567
Or, Does it taste the same
when you eat it in Seoul?

544
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:44,633
I really want to eat it.

545
00:30:46,967 --> 00:30:48,400
It was so delicious.

546
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,100
I ate it in Daegu.

547
00:31:01,233 --> 00:31:04,067
I ate it in Daegu.

548
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:06,600
It was delicious, really.

549
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:09,067
In our WIZONE team,

550
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,633
There's someone who
knows Daegu well, So,

551
00:31:14,267 --> 00:31:16,567
Does it taste the same
when you eat it in Seoul?

552
00:31:16,633 --> 00:31:18,667
Does it taste delicious because it's Daegu?

553
00:31:18,733 --> 00:31:20,800
Then, I have to go to Daegu.

554
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:21,876
If you want to eat it with that taste,

555
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,433
Do I have to go to Daegu?

556
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,367
I should go.

557
00:31:26,433 --> 00:31:27,600
I should go right away.

558
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,300
I really should.

559
00:31:30,433 --> 00:31:32,000
It was really good

560
00:31:33,567 --> 00:31:37,900
It was my first time eating
makjang at a restaurant

561
00:31:37,967 --> 00:31:43,733
It was crispy and so
good It was so good

562
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,900
After that, I went to Busan
after the fan signing event

563
00:31:48,967 --> 00:31:56,967
As soon as I arrived in
Busan I ate clam kalguksu

564
00:31:58,367 --> 00:32:00,900
I ate a lot of delicious food

565
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:06,933
After that, I did pilates
in Seoul yesterday

566
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,100
I almost died It was so
hard It hurts even when I walk

567
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,700
Really... Walking hurts, too.

568
00:32:16,233 --> 00:32:18,067
My muscles hurt so much

569
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,367
Do you want to eat
kalguksu? It's really good

570
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:30,733
I like it

571
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,167
I didn't see the fireworks festival

572
00:32:43,767 --> 00:32:48,900
I saw it when the 500
million subscribers were up

573
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,433
I saw it I didn't do it

574
00:33:00,867 --> 00:33:04,467
Oh, right. I went to see IU's concert.

575
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:09,500
It was the first time.

576
00:33:10,733 --> 00:33:13,933
We... We were guests this year.

577
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,533
We couldn't watch it because it was
in the middle of the music show.

578
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,733
So we went.

579
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,133
It was really fun.

580
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,933
It was crazy.

581
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,933
They were so pretty.

582
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,933
They were so good.

583
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:39,933
It was like Disney.

584
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,933
All the directors.

585
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,933
They sang all the songs I knew.

586
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,933
After that, I went to say hello.

587
00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:57,333
They said, I wanted to
say thank you for the hat.

588
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,867
I'll meet you in person.

589
00:33:58,933 --> 00:34:00,500
That's why I talked about it.

590
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:03,800
I was like, that's right, and the hat...

591
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:05,976
My house is still... I've been
keeping it in a really pretty place

592
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,667
I've been keeping it
in a really pretty place

593
00:34:09,733 --> 00:34:12,933
I'm so happy that you're saying that.
Oh, my God.

594
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:14,967
It's really...

595
00:34:15,033 --> 00:34:16,967
They said they're keeping it well.

596
00:34:17,033 --> 00:34:19,967
It was so good.

597
00:34:20,033 --> 00:34:21,900
Thank you

598
00:34:24,033 --> 00:34:25,967
Thank you.

599
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:31,700
So I'm carrying a key ring in my bag.

600
00:34:40,733 --> 00:34:44,967
This... But it without the top.

601
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,100
I love you so much.

602
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:53,800
My mom went with me.

603
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:57,167
Since my mom was young...

604
00:34:57,233 --> 00:34:58,600
No, not since my mom was young.

605
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:00,333
Since I was young,

606
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,567
we watched a lot of Korean dramas together.

607
00:35:05,633 --> 00:35:10,600
My family really liked it,
so I watched it with them.

608
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:12,667
We watched it together.

609
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,400
I really liked it.

610
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,333
It was so much fun.

611
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,333
It's already been 35 minutes.

612
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,900
I'm hungry.

613
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:30,633
I worked so hard on my lower body.

614
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,967
It really hurts.

615
00:35:32,033 --> 00:35:34,033
I really hate muscle pain.

616
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,967
Do you have a hobby these days?

617
00:35:37,033 --> 00:35:38,967
I'm still looking for a hobby.

618
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,033
I don't have anything specific.

619
00:35:46,567 --> 00:35:48,633
Come to a Japanese
cultural festival.

620
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,800
There aren't many
festivals like that in Japan.

621
00:35:51,867 --> 00:35:53,733
There's a talk show.

622
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,967
I've never heard of an
idol coming and performing.

623
00:35:58,567 --> 00:35:59,967
I wish I could.

624
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:01,967
Is it difficult?

625
00:36:02,033 --> 00:36:04,033
Not really.

626
00:36:06,467 --> 00:36:07,733
I'm waiting for the day off.

627
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,967
I haven't taken the day off yet.

628
00:36:10,033 --> 00:36:10,967
When is it?

629
00:36:11,033 --> 00:36:13,000
My heart is beating.

630
00:36:36,033 --> 00:36:38,200
There's a place that I've been
to, wow.

631
00:36:39,033 --> 00:36:40,400
I want to go there, it's fun.

632
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,400
When is fimlog?

633
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:46,467
Fimlog, this time, at
the university festival,

634
00:36:46,533 --> 00:36:48,433
I recorded while walking around.

635
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:52,167
But it's really...

636
00:36:53,533 --> 00:36:55,567
It's not one by one, it's just...

637
00:36:55,633 --> 00:36:57,567
Difficult Fimlog?
Same?

638
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:01,567
I don't know when it will come out.

639
00:37:02,133 --> 00:37:04,467
I hope it's one day soon.

640
00:37:07,967 --> 00:37:12,133
Of course, I like that
kind of group fimlog,

641
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:17,233
I used to film it once a week

642
00:37:17,767 --> 00:37:19,000
One person at a time.

643
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,767
It was really fun back then,
and I want to do it again.

644
00:37:23,467 --> 00:37:26,667
It's like a real improvement.

645
00:37:26,733 --> 00:37:34,000
It was a content where I could really
feel what kind of person I was on that day.

646
00:37:34,067 --> 00:37:37,567
So I want to say, I want to do it again.

647
00:37:40,767 --> 00:37:45,767
I think it would be nice to
do it at the end of the year.

648
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:49,767
Because I go back and
forth and go abroad a lot.

649
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:56,033
It was one of my favorite content.

650
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,100
And it was really fun.

651
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
I'm going to go now.

652
00:38:06,113 --> 00:38:07,133
2 minutes left.

653
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,200
Up to 40 minutes.

654
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,800
1 year later, I'm doing a fimlog?

655
00:38:16,867 --> 00:38:17,866
Really?

656
00:38:18,233 --> 00:38:20,100
You didn't do it by yourself, did you?

657
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,933
I'll do it a lot.

658
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,833
They told me not to go.

659
00:38:34,767 --> 00:38:36,100
I don't want to.

660
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:51,000
Yes, I haven't gone yet.
I don't know when I'm going to go.

661
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:05,133
UNIVERSE has...

662
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,967
I'm filming that

663
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,800
Actually, for UNIVERSE...

664
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,700
Even before our promotion for CRAZY...

665
00:39:15,067 --> 00:39:17,300
Is that all? Halmyungsoo...

666
00:39:18,367 --> 00:39:20,100
What I was filming...

667
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:21,166
I have a lot of games.

668
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,733
And this Leniverse is a bit...

669
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:26,067
A new...

670
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:27,133
시도가 많아 (sidoga manh-a).

671
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,199
I'm sorry.

672
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,754
It's been a while since I've been on
Weverse Lab.

673
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:33,300
Bless you... me.

674
00:39:34,967 --> 00:39:35,966
Bless me.

675
00:39:41,933 --> 00:39:42,932
So...

676
00:39:44,933 --> 00:39:46,633
Please look forward to it.

677
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:52,700
I think it's going to be fun.

678
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:55,100
I don't know how it's going to turn out.

679
00:39:56,133 --> 00:39:57,800
But it's going to be fun.

680
00:40:04,733 --> 00:40:07,233
It's been a while since I did Weverse Live.

681
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,567
I'll get closer to you again.

682
00:40:11,467 --> 00:40:13,467
It's been a while since
I've been on Weverse Live.

683
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,900
I'll be back again.

684
00:40:16,933 --> 00:40:18,967
It's 10 o'clock soon I'm tired.

685
00:40:20,933 --> 00:40:22,367
Go to sleep.

686
00:40:22,433 --> 00:40:24,400
Let's do our best tomorrow as well!

687
00:40:24,467 --> 00:40:26,343
Fearnot go to bed early.

688
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:27,933
Fighting!

689
00:40:29,267 --> 00:40:32,533
Fearnot, I'll go to bed early
and do my best tomorrow.

690
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,200
Fighting!

691
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:36,300
Bye bye.
