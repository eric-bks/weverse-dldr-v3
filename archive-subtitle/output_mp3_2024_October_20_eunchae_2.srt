1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hi.

2
00:00:26,146 --> 00:00:27,486


3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,493
Wait a minute. I was looking at the filter.

4
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,073
It's already in.

5
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:39,303
Is this better?

6
00:00:46,124 --> 00:00:47,801
Hi.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I just got off in Korea.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm waiting for my suitcase.

9
00:01:03,922 --> 00:01:05,773
So...

10
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,703
I came to play for a moment, everyone.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,817
I went to Japan.

12
00:01:17,885 --> 00:01:20,340
It's not an airport, it's my room.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Before I go to bed,

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I was lying on my bed.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I only did voice live.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
At that time, Fiona always asked me to show my face.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Today...

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's not before I go to bed yet.

19
00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:42,090
My face is ready, so I turned it on.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It got pretty cold in Korea.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
To say that...

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I've only been in Japan for a day.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Because there's no AC.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
How did you feel when you stopped?

25
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:20,300
On the second week,

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I saw Scorpion.

27
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,689
I saw it too.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So nice.

29
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:39,212


30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's my first time watching the best baseball game.

31
00:02:40,173 --> 00:02:46,114


32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It was so much fun.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Almost all of them are watching the best baseball game.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
When I watched the best baseball game alone, my heart was beating so fast.

35
00:02:55,647 --> 00:02:58,648


36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I watched the best baseball game alone like this.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I watched the best baseball game and got off the plane.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Did you really succeed in ticketing?

39
00:03:12,853 --> 00:03:16,267


40
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:25,233
When was the last time you learned Japanese?

41
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:28,695
When was the last time you learned Japanese?

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Today...

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I can remember.

44
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:34,367
I can remember.

45
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:38,323
When?

46
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:40,702
When?

47
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:49,309
My hair is short.

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
My eyes look tired?

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Why?

50
00:04:00,068 --> 00:04:01,028


51
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,247
I can remember.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,275
I can remember.

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,475
Today...

54
00:04:12,255 --> 00:04:13,628
I can remember today.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Where is it?

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
This is my room.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Welcome to my room.

58
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:24,366
This is my bed.

59
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:27,317
Do you want to see it?

60
00:04:28,866 --> 00:04:29,866
Ta-da.

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Ta-da.

62
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:35,399
Do you know this?

63
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:44,567
It's not the lion doll that was in our first documentary.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's a lion doll with a hood.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It popped out of here.

66
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,866
I pulled it like this and my eyebrows split.

67
00:04:54,658 --> 00:04:57,806
I still have my eyes on it and I still wear it a lot

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Is there anything you wonder about?

69
00:05:18,214 --> 00:05:20,333
Is there anything you wonder about?

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
My room?

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I don't have much in my room.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Bed

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The standby I got from the Reuniverse.

74
00:05:25,907 --> 00:05:28,791


75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
TV TV TV

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Cosmetic table

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm sorry to introduce the room.

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm not ready yet.

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Show me anything.

80
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,987


81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
There's a computer right next to the bed.

82
00:06:07,151 --> 00:06:14,287


83
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
When I lived in Overwatch,

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I didn't want to live without this computer.

85
00:06:15,131 --> 00:06:17,897


86
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:24,920


87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I don't play games now.

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Did you cut your hair today?

89
00:06:34,072 --> 00:06:35,740
I untied it.

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Please say it in Japanese.

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Kyou

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Kyou mo

93
00:06:52,503 --> 00:06:54,727
I really want to thank you for

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
adding a keyboard to work today.

95
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:04,043


96
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's the best.

97
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Very sweet.

98
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:35,306
I cut my bangs a little bit today.

99
00:07:36,846 --> 00:07:38,018
It's a little long.

100
00:07:39,872 --> 00:07:41,037
Perfect!

101
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,120
Are you good at Japanese?

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm good at Japanese?

103
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:50,303


104
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Apartment, Apartment!

105
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's a perfect night.

106
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Thank you! Perfect night!

107
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:08,638
Perfect night!

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Let's have fun!

109
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:28,069
"I have an English exam tomorrow, when is it?"

110
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,060
Fighting

111
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,500
Fighting

112
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,540
I have an exam tomorrow

113
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,760
Make me super crazy

114
00:09:05,218 --> 00:09:06,474
Do a capture time

115
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,900
Capture time?

116
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:07,841


117
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,200
Okay, since I turned on the camera, let's capture time

118
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,560
How should I do it? Capture time

119
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,996
Please read the comments after the wink.

120
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,610


121
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I think my wink skills have decreased.

122
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Why do my eyes look so closed?

123
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I can do it, but I can't do it pretty.

124
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
V

125
00:10:06,665 --> 00:10:07,766
Polaroid

126
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Hurry up.

127
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Capture time.

128
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
End.

129
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I just came to say good night.

130
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'll be ready someday.

131
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Thank you.

132
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I love you.

133
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Be careful not to catch a cold.

134
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Bye, everyone.

135
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Good night.
